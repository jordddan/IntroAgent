Sure, here is a guidance to write a good introduction for a machine learning paper:

1. Start with a general statement about the importance of machine learning in today's world.
2. Provide a brief overview of the problem or application area that the paper addresses.
3. Clearly state the research question or objective of the paper.
4. Summarize the main contributions of the paper, highlighting the novel aspects of the approach or methodology.
5. Provide a brief overview of the structure of the paper, outlining the main sections and their contents.

Remember to keep the introduction concise and focused, and to avoid technical jargon or overly complex language. The goal is to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the problem, the research question, and the main contributions of the paper, while also generating interest and motivation for reading the rest of the paper.
