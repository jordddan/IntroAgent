Machine learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling computers to understand and generate human language. One of the most successful approaches in NLP is pretraining, where a model is trained on a large corpus of text to learn general language representations that can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, existing pretraining methods have limitations, such as the independence assumption made in BERT and the position discrepancy in XLNet. 

In this paper, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Additionally, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our proposed model overcomes the limitations of existing pretraining methods and consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. 

We provide a comprehensive overview of related work, highlighting the main differences from our work and explaining how our work builds upon and extends the existing literature. We also propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. 

In conclusion, our proposed XLNet model is a significant contribution to the field of NLP, providing a novel approach to pretraining that overcomes the limitations of existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks.
