Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of artificial intelligence, with the goal of developing models that can accurately translate text from one language to another. Despite significant progress in recent years, there are still limitations in current approaches, particularly in non-autoregressive (NAR) machine translation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which addresses the shortcomings of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation.

Related work in this area has focused on improving the performance of autoregressive (AR) and NAR models, including joint AR and NAR training, generalized autoregressive pretraining, and bridging AR and NAR generation. However, these approaches have limitations, such as neglecting dependency between masked positions, suffering from pretrain-finetune discrepancy, and lagging behind AR models. Our proposed approach differs from prior works by modifying the decoder structure of CMLM, incorporating causal attention layers, and introducing a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence.

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing the CMLMC approach, (2) modifying the decoder structure of CMLM, (3) introducing a novel correction loss, and (4) achieving new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaching AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of NAR machine translation models, which can have a significant impact on real-world applications.

In the following sections, we provide a detailed explanation of the technical details of our proposed approach, including any limitations or assumptions. We also provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper, including a brief summary of each section and its contribution to the research. Overall, our research has the potential to significantly advance the field of machine translation and has important implications for future research in this area.
