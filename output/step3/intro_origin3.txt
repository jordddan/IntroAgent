Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key challenges in NLP is sequence modeling and transduction, which involves mapping an input sequence to an output sequence. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for this task, but they suffer from slow training times and difficulties in parallelization. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks.

The Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of NLP, as it allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The key components of the Transformer architecture are scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components enable the Transformer to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on several NLP tasks.

Our proposed solution addresses the limitations of RNNs and other previous approaches to sequence modeling and transduction. Specifically, the Transformer allows for more efficient training and inference, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks. The research questions and objectives of this paper are to evaluate the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture on various NLP tasks, to analyze the impact of different components of the architecture, and to compare the performance of the Transformer to previous state-of-the-art models.

Related work in this field includes autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, such as BERT, XLNet, and ProphetNet. However, the Transformer differs from these models in that it relies entirely on an attention mechanism, rather than recurrent networks or masked language modeling. Our work also introduces tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

In summary, the Transformer is a novel neural network architecture that addresses the limitations of previous approaches to sequence modeling and transduction. Our proposed solution enables more efficient training and inference, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the Transformer architecture, the analysis of its components, and the development of tensor2tensor.
