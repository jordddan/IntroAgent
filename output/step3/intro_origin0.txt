The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of sequence generation tasks. Autoregressive (AR) models have been successful in generating high-quality sequences, but suffer from slow decoding speed due to their sequential nature. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models, on the other hand, can generate sequences in parallel, but often struggle to match the performance of AR models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called JANUS that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. 

Our proposed method introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which allows AR and NAR models to learn from each other. We demonstrate the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple neural machine translation (NMT) datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Additionally, we exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR model at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

Our work is motivated by the need for a method that can combine the strengths of AR and NAR models to improve performance while avoiding their weaknesses. The proposed method is important and relevant to the AI community as it provides a new approach to sequence generation tasks that can improve the quality of generated sequences while maintaining fast decoding speed. The specific research questions addressed in this paper are how to combine AR and NAR models effectively and how to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR. 

Related work in this area includes XLNet, BERT, and ProphetNet, which have all made significant contributions to the field of sequence generation. However, our proposed method differs from these approaches in that it combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. 

In summary, our proposed method JANUS provides a novel approach to sequence generation tasks that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving state-of-the-art performance without distillation data. Our work provides a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and has the potential to improve the quality of generated sequences while maintaining fast decoding speed.
