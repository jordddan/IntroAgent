The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, largely due to the success of pre-training methods such as BERT and XLNet. However, these methods have limitations, such as neglecting dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that addresses these limitations while unifying the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM). 

MPNet introduces a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to consider the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-trained MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tuned it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB. Our experiments show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

Our proposed method is motivated by the need to improve the performance of pre-training methods in natural language processing. The importance and relevance of this work to the AI community lies in its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. The specific research questions and objectives of this paper are to propose a new pre-training method that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations, and to evaluate its performance on various downstream tasks.

Related work in this area includes BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, which have achieved significant success in pre-training methods. However, these methods have limitations that MPNet addresses. The main differences between MPNet and previous methods are the splitting of tokens into non-predicted and predicted parts, the consideration of dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling, and the use of auxiliary position information to alleviate position discrepancy. 

In summary, this paper proposes a new pre-training method called MPNet that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. Our experiments show that MPNet outperforms previous well-known models on various downstream tasks. This work has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in natural language processing and is an important contribution to the AI community.
