Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of artificial intelligence, with the goal of enabling seamless communication between people who speak different languages. Despite significant progress in recent years, machine translation still faces many challenges, especially in low-resource settings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to machine translation that addresses some of these challenges.

Our proposed approach, CeMAT, is a pre-training model for machine translation that consists of a bidirectional encoder, a bidirectional decoder, and a cross-attention module for bridging them. CeMAT is pre-trained on both monolingual and bilingual corpora and can provide unified initialization parameters for both Autoregressive NMT (AT) and Non-autoregressive NMT (NAT) tasks. We introduce aligned code-switching & masking and dynamic dual-masking techniques to enhance the model training under the setting of bidirectional decoders. Aligned code-switching & masking is applied based on a multilingual translation dictionary and word alignment between source and target sentences, while dynamic dual-masking is used to mask the contents of the source and target languages.

Our proposed approach is motivated by the limitations of existing machine translation models, which often struggle with low-resource settings and require significant amounts of training data. CeMAT addresses these limitations by leveraging pre-training on both monolingual and bilingual corpora, which allows for more efficient use of available data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CeMAT in improving machine translation performance on both low-resource and high-resource settings. CeMAT achieves consistent improvements over strong competitors in both AT and NAT tasks with data of varied sizes.

The technical details of our proposed approach are explained in detail, including any limitations or assumptions. We provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper, including a brief summary of each section and its contribution to the research. In summary, our proposed approach represents a significant contribution to the field of machine translation, with the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine translation in a wide range of settings.
