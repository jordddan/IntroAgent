Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most important applications of machine learning is sequence modeling, which involves predicting the next element in a sequence based on the previous elements. This problem is ubiquitous in natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling, but they suffer from slow training and inference times due to their sequential nature.

In recent years, attention mechanisms have emerged as a powerful alternative to RNNs for sequence modeling. Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, rather than processing it sequentially. This has led to significant improvements in performance and efficiency, particularly in the context of neural machine translation. However, existing attention-based models still rely on recurrent connections to propagate information across the sequence, limiting their parallelization and scalability.

In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

The main contributions of this paper are fourfold. First, we propose scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. Second, we demonstrate that the Transformer outperforms existing models on several benchmark datasets, including machine translation and language modeling. Third, we develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the Transformer's performance and limitations, and suggest directions for future research.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work in sequence modeling and attention mechanisms. Section 3 describes the technical details of the Transformer architecture, including the attention mechanism and the training procedure. Section 4 presents experimental results on several benchmark datasets, and Section 5 provides a detailed analysis of the Transformer's performance and limitations. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses potential directions for future research. Overall, our work represents a significant advance in the field of sequence modeling and has the potential to enable more efficient and accurate machine learning systems in a wide range of applications.
