The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches such as BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these issues, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. 

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. This approach enables learning bidirectional contexts and overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our work also proposes a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. We empirically demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Our proposed method is motivated by the need for a more effective and efficient pretraining-based approach that can capture bidirectional context and overcome the limitations of existing models. The importance and relevance of our work to the AI community lies in its potential to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks and advance the field. Our research questions and objectives include investigating the effectiveness of XLNet compared to existing models and exploring the impact of incorporating Transformer-XL ideas into pretraining.

Related work in the field includes JANUS, BANG, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. However, our work differs from these approaches in its focus on generalized autoregressive pretraining, its incorporation of Transformer-XL ideas, and its consistent outperformance of BERT on a wide range of tasks.
