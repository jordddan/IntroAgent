Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of artificial intelligence, with the goal of developing models that can accurately translate text from one language to another. While autoregressive (AR) models have achieved impressive performance in this task, they suffer from slow inference times due to their sequential nature. On the other hand, non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been proposed to address this issue, but they often lag behind AR models in terms of translation quality. 

In this paper, we propose a novel method called JANUS, which combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which allows AR and NAR models to learn from each other. Our approach achieves similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improves the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. 

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose a joint training method that effectively combines AR and NAR models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models. Our results show that JANUS outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. 

In addition, we provide a comprehensive overview of related work and explain how our proposed approach differs from prior works. We also explain the technical details of our approach and its novelty in detail, including any limitations or assumptions. Finally, we provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper, including a brief summary of each section and its contribution to the research. 

Overall, our work makes a significant contribution to the field of machine translation and has the potential to impact future research in this area.
