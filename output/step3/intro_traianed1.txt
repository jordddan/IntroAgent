Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most important applications of machine learning is natural language processing, which involves teaching computers to understand and generate human language. In this paper, we address the problem of pretraining language models, which is a crucial step in many natural language processing tasks.

Recent advances in pretraining language models have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However, existing pretraining methods suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption. To overcome these limitations, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. 

XLNet also integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving architectural designs for pretraining by incorporating the recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme of Transformer-XL. Furthermore, we propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling.

Our proposed approach has several advantages over existing pretraining methods. XLNet does not suffer from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy that BERT is subject to, and the autoregressive objective provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens, eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of related work and explain how our proposed approach differs from prior works. We also explain the technical details of the proposed approach and its novelty in detail, including any limitations or assumptions. Finally, we provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper, including a brief summary of each section and its contribution to the research. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of natural language processing tasks and has important implications for future research in this field.
