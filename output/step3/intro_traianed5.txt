Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the key challenges in machine learning is to develop models that can learn from large amounts of data and generalize well to new data. In this paper, we address the problem of pre-training language models for natural language processing tasks, which has been a major focus of research in recent years.

Our proposed approach, Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet), unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) while addressing their limitations. We split the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, which allows MPNet to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB, which outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

We provide a comprehensive overview of related work and explain how our proposed approach differs from prior works. We compare MPNet with other pre-training methods such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, and show that MPNet outperforms them on various benchmark tasks. We also discuss the limitations and assumptions of our approach.

The main contribution of this paper is the proposed MPNet approach, which leverages the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. We provide a clear motivation for the proposed approach, highlighting the potential impact of the research. We explain the technical details of the proposed approach and its novelty in detail, including any limitations or assumptions. We provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper, including a brief summary of each section and its contribution to the research.

In summary, our proposed MPNet approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks. The potential implications of our research include improving the accuracy and efficiency of natural language processing models, which can have a significant impact on various applications such as chatbots, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
