The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches like BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these issues, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations.

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Additionally, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our proposed method outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. We also compare our work with related works such as ProphetNet, MPNet, CeMAT, JANUS, BANG, and CMLMC, highlighting the main differences and contributions of our approach.

In summary, our work presents a novel approach to pretraining-based language modeling that overcomes the limitations of existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks. This research is of significant importance to the AI community and has the potential to advance the field of natural language processing further.
