Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most significant challenges in machine learning is sequence modeling and transduction, where the input and output are sequences of variable length. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling, but they suffer from slow training and inference times due to their sequential nature. 

To address this issue, this paper proposes the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

The proposed model builds on previous work in attention mechanisms and introduces scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. The paper also introduces tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

The related work in the field of sequence modeling and transduction is extensive, but the proposed model fills a gap in the literature by providing a more efficient and effective alternative to RNNs. The paper discusses the limitations of existing models and highlights the significance of the proposed method in addressing these limitations. 

The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the Transformer architecture, the demonstration of its effectiveness in sequence modeling and transduction tasks, and the development of tensor2tensor. The paper concludes by discussing potential future directions for research and the significance of the experimental results in supporting the proposed method's effectiveness in addressing the research questions.
