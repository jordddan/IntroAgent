Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in recent years, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed, particularly in non-autoregressive (NAR) machine translation. The main contribution of this paper is the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which addresses the shortcomings of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation.

Previous works have explored various pre-training models, such as the Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training (CeMAT), ProphetNet, and XLNet, to improve the performance of NAR machine translation. However, these models still lag behind their autoregressive (AR) counterparts, and only become competitive when trained with distillation. Other works, such as JANUS and BANG, have proposed joint AR and NAR training methods to improve the performance of both models simultaneously.

The proposed CMLMC model modifies the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. Additionally, a novel correction loss is proposed to teach the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. The experimental results show that CMLMC achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks.

The proposed model addresses the problems of indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference in NAR machine translation. The CMLMC model is necessary because it improves the performance of NAR machine translation without the need for distillation. The proposed model is compared with previous works, and the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods are highlighted.

In summary, this paper proposes the CMLMC model, which addresses the shortcomings of the CMLM model in NAR machine translation. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for distillation and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed description of related work, Section 3 explains the proposed model and techniques, Section 4 presents the experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
