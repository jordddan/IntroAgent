The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pre-training methods such as BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on various language understanding tasks. However, BERT relies on masking tokens and neglects the dependency between masked positions, leading to a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. To address these limitations, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. 

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Additionally, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences. 

Our work also proposes a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Related works in this field include CeMAT, a conditional masked language model pre-trained on large-scale bilingual and monolingual corpora, ProphetNet, a sequence-to-sequence pre-training model that introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction, and JANUS, a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method. While these works have made significant contributions to the field, our proposed XLNet method overcomes the limitations of previous pre-training methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various language understanding tasks.

In summary, our work proposes a novel pre-training method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding, and integrates ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining. Empirically, we demonstrate that XLNet outperforms BERT on various language understanding tasks. Our work contributes to the advancement of natural language processing and has significant implications for various applications, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.
