Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most significant applications of machine learning is natural language processing (NLP), where models are trained to understand and generate human language. However, NLP models face several challenges, such as the trade-off between accuracy and speed, which can limit their practical applications.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel method called JANUS, which combines the strengths of both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) generation models while avoiding their weaknesses. JANUS introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Additionally, JANUS exceeds the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieves comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

The proposed method builds on the existing literature on AR and NAR models, which have played an essential role in sequence generation tasks. However, existing models have limitations, such as the neglect of dependency between the masked positions and the pretrain-tune discrepancy. To address these limitations, JANUS introduces an auxiliary distribution to bridge the gap between AR and NAR models, enabling them to learn from each other and improve performance.

The main contributions of this paper are fourfold. First, it proposes a novel method that combines the strengths of AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. Second, it introduces an auxiliary distribution to bridge the gap between AR and NAR models, enabling them to learn from each other. Third, it demonstrates the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving state-of-the-art performance without distillation data. Fourth, it exceeds the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieves comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

In conclusion, the proposed JANUS method represents a significant contribution to the field of NLP by addressing the trade-off between accuracy and speed in sequence generation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential for practical applications. Future research directions could explore the application of JANUS to other NLP tasks and the extension of the proposed method to other machine learning domains.
