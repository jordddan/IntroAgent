The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches such as BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these issues, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. 

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. This approach enables learning bidirectional contexts and overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our proposed method also introduces a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. We empirically demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Our work is motivated by the need for more effective pretraining-based approaches that can overcome the limitations of existing methods. The proposed XLNet method is important and relevant to the AI community as it provides a new state-of-the-art approach for pretraining-based natural language processing tasks. The specific research questions and objectives of our work are to introduce a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that can capture bidirectional context and overcome the limitations of existing methods. 

Related work in this area includes JANUS, BANG, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. However, XLNet differs from these methods in its ability to capture bidirectional context and overcome the limitations of existing methods. In summary, our work proposes a novel approach to pretraining-based natural language processing that outperforms existing methods and provides a new state-of-the-art approach for a wide range of tasks.
