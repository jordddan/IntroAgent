Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of sequence modeling and transduction problems. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the go-to architecture for these tasks, but they suffer from slow training times and limited parallelization. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for RNNs. 

The Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of AI, as it allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The Transformer architecture is composed of several key components, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components work together to create a highly efficient and effective sequence modeling and transduction system.

Our work builds on previous research in this area, including pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models, such as CeMAT, and generalized autoregressive pre-training methods, such as XLNet. We also address the limitations of non-autoregressive translation models, such as the problem of distribution discrepancy, with our proposed Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC). Additionally, we propose JANUS, a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method, and BANG, a pre-training model that bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation.

Our work differs from previous research in several key ways. First, we introduce the Transformer architecture, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism and eliminates the need for RNNs. Second, we propose several key components of the Transformer architecture, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. Finally, we develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

In summary, our work introduces the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems that relies entirely on an attention mechanism. We demonstrate that the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality. Our proposed components of the Transformer architecture, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, are key to its success. Our work builds on previous research in this area and addresses several limitations of existing models.
