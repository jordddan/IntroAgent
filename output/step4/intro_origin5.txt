The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, largely due to the success of pre-training methods such as BERT and XLNet. However, these methods have limitations, such as neglecting dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from position discrepancy. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that addresses these limitations and unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM). 

MPNet introduces a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-trained MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tuned it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB. Our experiments show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

Our proposed method is motivated by the need to improve the performance of pre-training methods in natural language processing. The importance and relevance of this work to the AI community lies in its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. The specific research questions and objectives of this paper are to propose a new pre-training method that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations, and to evaluate its performance on various downstream tasks.

Related work in this area includes BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, which have achieved significant success in pre-training methods. However, these methods have limitations that MPNet addresses, such as neglecting dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from position discrepancy. The main differences between our work and previous methods lie in the approach of splitting tokens into non-predicted and predicted parts, which allows MPNet to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet.
