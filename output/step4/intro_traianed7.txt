Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most important applications of machine learning is sequence modeling and transduction, which involves predicting the next element in a sequence or mapping one sequence to another. This problem is ubiquitous in natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other domains.

In recent years, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling and transduction. However, RNNs suffer from several limitations, such as slow training and inference times, difficulty in parallelization, and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, a new neural network architecture called the Transformer was introduced in the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017).

The Transformer relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. This allows for significantly more parallelization and faster training and inference times. The Transformer has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several sequence modeling and transduction tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition.

In addition to introducing the Transformer architecture, this paper proposes several key components of the Transformer, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. The paper also introduces tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of related work in sequence modeling and transduction, highlighting the gaps in the existing literature that the proposed research aims to fill. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture and its key components in several sequence modeling and transduction tasks. The paper also provides a clear comparison with previous work and explains the methodology used, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the Transformer architecture and its key components. Section 3 presents the experimental results of the Transformer on several sequence modeling and transduction tasks. Section 4 provides a comparison with previous work and discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and provides directions for future research.
