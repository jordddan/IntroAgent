Machine learning has made significant progress in recent years, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key challenges in NLP is generating high-quality text, which can be achieved through autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models. AR models generate text sequentially, while NAR models generate text in parallel. However, NAR models have not yet achieved the same level of performance as AR models. 

To address this gap, we propose BANG, a large-scale pretraining model designed for NAR and semi-NAR generation. BANG bridges the gap between AR and NAR by pretraining a generative model using an efficient cross-stream visible n-stream decoder that supports predicting tokens with arbitrary previous golden tokens or [MASK]. BANG supports NAR, semi-NAR, and AR finetuning to meet different requirements with the same pretrained model structure. 

Our proposed model achieves significant performance improvements on all tasks for NAR and semi-NAR finetuning, and for AR finetuning, it can attain comparable performance with strong AR pretrained models. Compared with the semi-NAR strong baselines, BANG achieves absolute improvements of 14.01 and 5.24 in the overall scores of SQuAD 1.1 and XSum, respectively. In addition, BANG achieves absolute improvements of 10.73, 6.39, and 5.90 in the overall scores of SQuAD, XSUM, and PersonaChat, respectively, compared with the strong NAR baselines. 

Our work builds on related works such as ProphetNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, Attention Is All You Need, JANUS, XLNet, MPNet, and Improving Non-Autoregressive Translation Models Without Distillation. However, our proposed model is the first large-scale pretraining model designed for NAR and semi-NAR generation, and it achieves significant performance improvements on all tasks for NAR and semi-NAR finetuning. 

In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of our proposed model, including the methodology and data used, and a description of the experimental setup and results. We will also provide a clear and concise roadmap for the rest of the paper, summarizing the key points and outlining the structure of the paper, including the main findings and conclusions.
