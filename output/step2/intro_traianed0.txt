Natural language generation has been a challenging task in the field of machine learning due to the complexity of language structures and the need for generating coherent and fluent sentences. Existing models, such as autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models, have their strengths and weaknesses. AR models can generate high-quality sentences but suffer from slow inference time, while NAR models have fast inference time but often produce low-quality sentences. 

The objective of this paper is to propose a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. We introduce JANUS, a joint AR and NAR training method that uses an auxiliary distribution to bridge the discrepancy between AR and NAR models. JANUS enhances the performance of both AR and NAR models simultaneously and effectively alleviates the problem of distribution discrepancy. 

Related work in the field has explored various approaches to address the limitations of AR and NAR models. XLNet proposed a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts, while BANG bridged the gap between AR and NAR generation by designing a novel model structure for large-scale pretraining. IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION investigated the reasons behind the performance gap between AR and NAR models and proposed a conditional masked language model with correction to address these problems. 

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) introducing JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance, (2) proposing an auxiliary distribution to bridge the discrepancy between AR and NAR models, (3) demonstrating the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average, and (4) exceeding the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieving comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism. 

In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of the proposed approach and its components, including technical details and precision to support our approach and how it addresses the identified research gaps. We also preview the experimental setup and results, including the methodology and data used, with a clear structure and logical flow, and how they support the proposed approach. The methodology and experimental setup provide sufficient detail to enable replication of the study.
