Natural language generation has been a challenging task in the field of machine learning due to the complexity of language structures and the need to capture the context and meaning of the text. Existing models, such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM), have shown promising results in pre-training language models. However, these models have limitations, such as neglecting the dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from position discrepancy. 

The objective of this paper is to propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. MPNet splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to consider the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. 

Related work in the field has been focused on improving the performance of pre-training models, such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, by addressing their limitations. JANUS proposed a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method, while BANG bridged the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation. Attention Is All You Need introduced a new network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, and ProphetNet presented a new self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction. IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION addressed the performance gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training proposed a conditional masked language model pre-trained on large-scale bilingual and monolingual corpora in many languages.

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) proposing MPNet, a new pre-training method that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations, 2) introducing a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing MPNet to consider the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet, and 3) pre-training MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tuning it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB, which outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

The proposed approach is expected to significantly improve the performance of pre-training models and address the limitations of existing models. The experimental setup and results will be presented in the following sections, providing a clear methodology and data used to support the proposed approach.
