The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches such as BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these issues, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. 

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. This approach enables learning bidirectional contexts and overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our proposed method also introduces a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. We empirically demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Our work is motivated by the need for more effective pretraining-based approaches that can capture bidirectional context and overcome the limitations of existing methods. The proposed XLNet method addresses these issues and provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens. Our research questions and objectives include evaluating the effectiveness of XLNet on a range of tasks and comparing its performance to existing methods. 

Related work in this area includes JANUS, BANG, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. However, XLNet differs from these methods in its use of bidirectional context and its integration of Transformer-XL ideas into pretraining. Overall, our work contributes to the ongoing development of more effective pretraining-based approaches for natural language processing tasks.
