Machine learning has made significant progress in recent years, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, there is still a significant gap in the ability of machine learning models to generate coherent and meaningful text. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which uses a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. The model is optimized by predicting the next n tokens simultaneously based on previous context tokens at each time step, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations.

The proposed model extends the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. The model is pre-trained on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. The model is also fine-tuned on several NLG tasks and achieves the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the main differences from our work and how our proposed solution fills the gap. Related works include BANG, CeMAT, Transformer, JANUS, XLNet, MPNet, and CMLMC. The proposed model differs from these works in its novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and the n-stream self-attention mechanism, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations.

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of ProphetNet, a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model that achieves state-of-the-art results on several NLG tasks. The model's novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and the n-stream self-attention mechanism make it a significant improvement over existing models. The paper's research questions and objectives are clearly stated, and the methodology and data used are described in detail. The experimental setup and results are also provided, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. The paper concludes with a clear and concise roadmap for the rest of the paper, summarizing the key points and outlining the structure of the paper, including the main findings and conclusions.
