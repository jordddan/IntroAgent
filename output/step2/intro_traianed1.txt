Natural language generation is a challenging task in machine learning, with existing models facing limitations in capturing bidirectional context and addressing the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In this paper, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. 

Our research objective is to introduce a new approach that maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Additionally, we aim to address the pretrain-finetune discrepancy that BERT is subject to, and the independence assumption made in BERT.

Related work in the field has focused on autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, with recent approaches such as JANUS, BANG, and MPNet attempting to bridge the gap between the two. However, these models still face limitations in capturing bidirectional context and addressing the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. XLNet overcomes these limitations by integrating ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining and proposing a reparameterization of the Transformer network to remove ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer architecture to permutation-based language modeling.

Our main contributions are introducing XLNet, improving architectural designs for pretraining, and proposing a reparameterization of the Transformer network. Empirical results demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of the proposed approach and its components, including technical details and precision to support our approach. We also preview the experimental setup and results, including the methodology and data used, with a clear structure and logical flow, and how they support the proposed approach. The methodology and experimental setup provide sufficient detail to enable replication of the study.
