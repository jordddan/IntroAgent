Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of natural language processing. While autoregressive (AR) models have achieved excellent performance, they suffer from slow decoding speed due to their sequential nature. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models, on the other hand, can generate translations in parallel, but their performance lags behind AR models, especially without distillation data. To address these issues, we propose JANUS, a Joint Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive training method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. 

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of related work, including BANG, ProphetNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, Attention Is All You Need, XLNet, MPNet, and Improving Non-Autoregressive Translation Models Without Distillation. We highlight the main differences between our work and these related works, emphasizing how our proposed solution fills the gap in the existing literature. 

Our main contribution is the introduction of JANUS, which uses an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, benefiting AR and NAR to learn from each other. We demonstrate the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Furthermore, we exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism. 

Our research questions and objectives are clearly stated, and we describe the methodology and data used, as well as the experimental setup and results. We provide a clear and concise roadmap for the rest of the paper, summarizing the key points and outlining the structure of the paper, including the main findings and conclusions. Overall, our proposed JANUS method has the potential to significantly impact the field of machine learning, particularly in the area of machine translation.
