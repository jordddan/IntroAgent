Machine learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling computers to understand and generate human language. One of the key challenges in NLP is pre-training models on large-scale text corpora to improve their performance on downstream tasks. While pre-training models such as BERT have achieved significant success, they neglect the dependency among predicted tokens, leading to a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. To address this issue, XLNet introduced permuted language modeling (PLM) for pre-training. However, XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence, leading to a position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. 

In this paper, we propose a novel pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and PLM while addressing their limitations. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT) and takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence, thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in XLNet). We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and fine-tune it on a variety of downstream tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc.). Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g., BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa) under the same model setting.

Our proposed method has significant implications for the field of machine learning, particularly in the area of NLP. By unifying the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations, MPNet provides a more effective pre-training method that can improve the performance of downstream tasks. The potential applications of this work are vast, including improving the accuracy of machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. 

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the main differences from our work and how our proposed solution fills the gap. We also clearly state the research questions and objectives and how they will be addressed in the paper, including the methodology and data used, and a description of the experimental setup and results. Finally, we provide a clear and concise roadmap for the rest of the paper, summarizing the key points and outlining the structure of the paper, including the main findings and conclusions.
