Natural language generation has been a challenging task in the field of machine learning due to the complexity of language structures and the need for high-quality output. Existing models, such as autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models, have shown promising results in generating natural language. However, AR models suffer from slow inference time, while NAR models often lag behind their AR counterparts in terms of performance. 

The objective of this paper is to propose a novel approach, the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), that addresses the limitations of existing NAR models in machine translation. The proposed approach modifies the decoder structure of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. Additionally, a novel correction loss is proposed to teach the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence.

Related work in the field has explored various approaches to improve the performance of NAR models, such as joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training, generalized autoregressive pretraining, and bridging AR and NAR generation. However, these approaches have limitations, such as neglecting dependency between masked positions, suffering from pretrain-finetune discrepancy, and requiring distillation to achieve competitive performance. The proposed CMLMC approach addresses these limitations and achieves state-of-the-art NAR performance without distillation, approaching AR performance on multiple datasets.

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing the CMLMC approach that addresses the shortcomings of the CMLM in NAR machine translation, (2) modifying the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers, (3) proposing a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations, and (4) achieving new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaching AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks.

The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple datasets, and the experimental setup and results are presented in detail in the following sections. The methodology and data used are described in a clear and structured manner, providing sufficient detail to enable replication of the study. Overall, the proposed approach has significant implications for the AI community, as it addresses the limitations of existing NAR models and achieves competitive performance without the need for distillation.
