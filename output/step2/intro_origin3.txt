Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of sequence modeling and transduction problems. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the go-to architecture for these tasks, but they suffer from slow training times and limited parallelization. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for RNNs. 

The Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of AI, as it allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The Transformer architecture is composed of several key components, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components work together to create a highly efficient and effective sequence modeling and transduction system.

Our work builds upon several related works in the field of AI, including BANG, ProphetNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, JANUS, XLNet, MPNet, and Improving Non-Autoregressive Translation Models Without Distillation. While these related works have made significant contributions to the field, our work differs in several key ways. First, the Transformer architecture relies entirely on an attention mechanism, whereas many of the related works still rely on RNNs. Second, our work introduces several new components to the Transformer architecture, including scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention. Finally, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture on several sequence modeling and transduction tasks, including machine translation.

In this paper, we aim to address the limitations of RNNs in sequence modeling and transduction problems by introducing the Transformer architecture. We propose a new approach that relies entirely on an attention mechanism and demonstrate its effectiveness on several tasks. Our work builds upon several related works in the field of AI, but differs in several key ways. We believe that our work will make a significant contribution to the field of AI and will be of interest to researchers and practitioners alike.
