Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the key challenges in NLP is sequence modeling and transduction, which involves mapping an input sequence to an output sequence. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling, but they suffer from slow training times and difficulties in parallelization. 

In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

The proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and parameter-free position representation are key components of the Transformer architecture. These components enable the Transformer to effectively model long-range dependencies and capture complex relationships between input and output sequences. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of the Transformer, we developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. We used tensor2tensor to implement and evaluate the Transformer on various sequence modeling and transduction tasks. 

Our work builds upon previous research in sequence modeling and transduction, particularly in the use of attention mechanisms. However, the Transformer represents a significant departure from previous approaches, as it relies entirely on attention mechanisms and does not use recurrent networks. 

In summary, the Transformer represents a major breakthrough in sequence modeling and transduction, offering significant improvements in training times and translation quality. Our work has important implications for the AI community, particularly in the development of more efficient and effective NLP models.
