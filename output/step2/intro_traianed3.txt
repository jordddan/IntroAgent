Natural language generation is a challenging task in machine learning, with existing models facing limitations in capturing global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer, a new neural network architecture, has been introduced to address this issue by relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer in natural language generation tasks and to propose key components of the architecture.

Related work in the field has focused on autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, with the former achieving excellent performance but being time-consuming, and the latter bringing fast decoding speed for inference but lagging behind autoregressive models in performance. The proposed approach, the Transformer, allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The paper also proposes scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture.

The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the Transformer architecture, the demonstration of its effectiveness in natural language generation tasks, and the proposal of key components of the architecture. Additionally, the paper presents tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. The proposed approach addresses the research gap of capturing global dependencies between input and output in natural language generation tasks.

The proposed approach is explained in detail, including technical details and precision to support the approach, and how it addresses the identified research gaps. The experimental setup and results are previewed, including the methodology and data used, with a clear structure and logical flow, and how they support the proposed approach. The methodology and experimental setup provide sufficient detail to enable replication of the study. 

In summary, this paper proposes the Transformer architecture for natural language generation tasks, which addresses the limitations of existing models in capturing global dependencies between input and output. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in translation quality and provides key components of the architecture. The experimental setup and results support the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing a clear motivation for its adoption in the AI community.
