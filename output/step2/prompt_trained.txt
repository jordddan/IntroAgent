Revised key steps for writing an introduction section of an academic paper on machine learning:

1. Provide a comprehensive background on natural language generation challenges and limitations of existing models, contextualizing the research problem and its significance to the AI community.
2. Clearly state the research objective in a clear and precise manner, outlining the scope and limitations of the study.
3. Provide a clear and structured overview of related work, highlighting the main differences from your work and identifying the research gaps that your approach aims to address. Additionally, provide a comparison with related work in the field.
4. Clearly state the main contributions of the research and its significance to the AI community, providing a clear motivation for the proposed approach. 
5. Explain the proposed approach and its components in detail, including technical details and precision to support your approach, and how it addresses the identified research gaps. 
6. Preview the experimental setup and results, including the methodology and data used, with a clear structure and logical flow, and how they support the proposed approach. Ensure that the methodology and experimental setup provide sufficient detail to enable replication of the study. 

Note: The revised key steps have been reorganized to address the shortcomings raised by the reviewers. Step 4 has been separated from Step 1 to provide a clearer statement of the main contribution and motivation. The logical flow has been improved by moving the methodology and experimental setup to Step 6.
