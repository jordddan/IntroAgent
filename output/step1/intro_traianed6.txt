Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of natural language processing. While autoregressive (AR) models have achieved impressive performance, non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been proposed to address the issue of slow decoding speed. However, leading NAR models still lag behind their AR counterparts, and only become competitive when trained with distillation. In this paper, we investigate possible reasons behind this performance gap, namely, the indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference. 

To address these issues, we propose the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which builds upon the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) and introduces a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. We also modify the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. 

Our proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) proposing the CMLMC which addresses the shortcomings of the CMLM in NAR machine translation, (2) modifying the decoder structure of CMLM, (3) proposing a novel correction loss, and (4) achieving new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results.
