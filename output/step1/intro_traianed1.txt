Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of natural language processing. Despite significant progress in recent years, existing methods still suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in autoregressive language modeling. In this paper, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that overcomes these limitations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks.

Our contributions are as follows: First, we introduce XLNet, which combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Second, XLNet does not suffer from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy that BERT is subject to, and the autoregressive objective provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens, eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT. Third, we improve architectural designs for pretraining by incorporating the recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme of Transformer-XL into pretraining, which empirically improves performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences. Fourth, we propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.
