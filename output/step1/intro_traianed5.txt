Machine translation is a fundamental task in natural language processing, and pre-training models have significantly improved its performance. However, existing pre-training methods, such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM), have limitations that hinder their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. 

Our approach splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing MPNet to consider the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-trained MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tuned it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB. Our experiments show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

In the related work section, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and how our proposed approach builds upon or differs from them. We also present the methodology used to address the research question, including a detailed explanation of the proposed approach, pre-training, and fine-tuning. 

Our experimental results support the claims made in the paper, comparing the proposed approach with existing methods and addressing the limitations of the study. We emphasize the novelty and significance of the proposed approach and provide an overview of the paper's structure, including a brief summary of each section, to help the reader navigate the paper more easily.
