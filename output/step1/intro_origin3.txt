Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the most successful approaches to NLP is the use of neural network architectures, which have achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and text generation. However, traditional neural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffer from slow training times and limited parallelization capabilities.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems. The Transformer relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. This allows for significantly more parallelization and faster training times, while still achieving state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks.

Our proposed solution includes several key components of the Transformer architecture, such as scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. We also developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

The main research questions and objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture and its key components, and to compare its performance with existing neural network architectures. Specifically, we evaluate the Transformer on machine translation tasks and show that it can achieve a new state-of-the-art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

Related work in this field includes autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, such as BERT, XLNet, and ProphetNet. However, our work differs from these approaches in that it relies entirely on an attention mechanism and does not require recurrent networks. We also introduce several novel components to the Transformer architecture, such as multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation.

In summary, the Transformer architecture represents a significant advancement in the field of NLP and has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach sequence modeling and transduction problems. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of the Transformer and its key components, and provides a strong foundation for future research in this area.
