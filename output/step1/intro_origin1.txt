The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches like BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these limitations, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. 

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. This approach overcomes the limitations of BERT and provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens. Furthermore, XLNet incorporates ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our work builds upon related works such as JANUS, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, MPNet, and CMLMC. JANUS proposes a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method, while BANG bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation. Attention Is All You Need introduces a new simple network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, while ProphetNet presents a new sequence-to-sequence pre-training model. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling, and CMLMC addresses the problems of indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference.

Our proposed XLNet method outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. The main contributions of this paper are introducing XLNet, improving architectural designs for pretraining, proposing a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network, and demonstrating the superior performance of XLNet over BERT. 

In summary, our work addresses the limitations of pretraining-based approaches and proposes a novel method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. The proposed XLNet method outperforms BERT on various tasks, making it a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
