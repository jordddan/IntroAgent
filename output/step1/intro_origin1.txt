The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches like BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these issues, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. 

XLNet also incorporates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences. We propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. 

Our work is motivated by the need for a pretraining-based approach that overcomes the limitations of existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Our proposed solution, XLNet, achieves this by combining the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding, and by incorporating ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining. 

We evaluate XLNet on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. Our experiments demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on these tasks, often by a large margin. 

In summary, our work proposes a novel pretraining-based approach, XLNet, that overcomes the limitations of existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Our proposed solution combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding, and incorporates ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority over existing methods.
