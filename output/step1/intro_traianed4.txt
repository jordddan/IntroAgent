Machine translation is a fundamental task in natural language processing, and recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in translation quality. However, there are still challenges in achieving high-quality translations, such as the difficulty of modeling long-term dependencies and the need for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to machine translation that addresses these challenges and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Our approach is based on a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which introduces a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. We also develop a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. Additionally, we extend the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction.

To evaluate our approach, we pre-trained ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieved new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. We also fine-tuned ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieved the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.

In the related work section, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and explaining how our proposed approach builds upon or differs from them. We also present experimental results to support the claims made in the paper, comparing the proposed approach with existing methods and addressing the limitations of the study.

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet with a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction, the development of a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, and the extension of the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several NLG tasks and provides a significant improvement over existing methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work, Section 3 describes the proposed approach in detail, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
