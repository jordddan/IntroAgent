Introduction:

Machine learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling the development of sophisticated models that can learn from large amounts of data. One of the key challenges in NLP is to develop models that can generate coherent and fluent text. In recent years, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have emerged as a powerful approach for generating text. However, these models suffer from several limitations, including the inability to plan for future tokens and overfitting on strong local correlations.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) introducing a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction, (2) developing a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, (3) extending the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, (4) pre-training ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieving new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, and (5) fine-tuning ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieving the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and to develop a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase. Furthermore, the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism extends the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet. The experimental results demonstrate that ProphetNet achieves new state-of-the-art results on all the datasets compared to the models using the same scale pre-training corpus.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the gaps in the literature and comparing with existing literature. We also present a clear and concise statement of the main contribution of the paper and explain the proposed method in detail, including the technical details and experimental setup, and how it addresses the research questions or objectives. Finally, we provide a clear roadmap of the paper and an overview of the paper's structure, including the organization of the remaining sections.
