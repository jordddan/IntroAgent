The field of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has seen significant progress in recent years, with Transformer-based autoregressive (AR) models achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. However, AR models have a significant drawback in that they translate one token at a time, making inference time-consuming, especially for long sequences. To address this issue, non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been proposed, which translate blocks of tokens in parallel, resulting in faster inference. Despite recent progress, leading NAR models still lag behind their AR counterparts and only become competitive when trained with distillation. 

In this paper, we investigate the reasons behind this performance gap and propose a novel solution to address these issues. Specifically, we propose the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which builds upon the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) and addresses its shortcomings in NAR machine translation. We modify the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. Additionally, we propose a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. 

Our proposed CMLMC achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. The significance of our work lies in the fact that it addresses the limitations of existing NAR models and provides a more efficient and effective solution for NMT. 

Related work in this area includes Transformer-based AR models, such as BERT and XLNet, and NAR models, such as BANG and ProphetNet. However, our proposed CMLMC differs from these models in its modification of the CMLM decoder structure and the incorporation of a novel correction loss. 

In summary, our work proposes a novel solution to address the performance gap between AR and NAR models in NMT. Our proposed CMLMC achieves state-of-the-art results and provides a more efficient and effective solution for NMT.
