The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of sequence generation tasks. Autoregressive (AR) models have been successful in generating high-quality sequences, but suffer from slow decoding speed due to their sequential nature. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models, on the other hand, can generate sequences in parallel, but often struggle to match the performance of AR models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called JANUS that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. 

Our proposed method introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, allowing AR and NAR models to learn from each other. We demonstrate the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple neural machine translation (NMT) datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Additionally, we exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR model at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

Our work is motivated by the need for a method that can combine the strengths of AR and NAR models to improve performance while maintaining fast decoding speed. This is particularly important in applications where real-time generation is required. Our proposed method addresses this problem and provides a solution that can benefit the AI community. 

Related work in this area includes XLNet, BERT, and ProphetNet, which have all made significant contributions to the field of sequence generation. However, our proposed method differs from these approaches in that it combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models, rather than relying solely on one or the other. 

In summary, our work proposes a novel method called JANUS that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models to improve performance while maintaining fast decoding speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, and exceed the performance of existing non-autoregressive pretraining models. Our work provides a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing and has important implications for real-time sequence generation applications.
