Recent advances in natural language processing have led to the development of both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) generation models. While AR models have shown excellent performance, they suffer from slow decoding speed due to their sequential nature. On the other hand, NAR models can generate sequences in parallel, but their performance lags behind AR models, especially when trained without distillation data. 

To address these limitations, we propose JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. JANUS introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. Our approach is effective in improving the performance of both AR and NAR models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. 

Our work is motivated by the need for faster and more accurate sequence generation models, which are essential for various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text summarization. The proposed JANUS method is particularly relevant to the AI community as it provides a novel approach to address the limitations of both AR and NAR models. 

Related works in this area include XLNet, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. While these works have made significant contributions to the field, they do not address the limitations of both AR and NAR models simultaneously. Our proposed JANUS method differs from these works by introducing an auxiliary distribution to bridge the gap between AR and NAR models, which enables them to learn from each other and improve their performance. 

In this paper, we aim to answer the following research questions: Can JANUS improve the performance of both AR and NAR models? How does JANUS compare to state-of-the-art AR and NAR models on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models? Can JANUS exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism? 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the proposed JANUS method. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results. Section 4 discusses the findings and limitations of our work. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.
