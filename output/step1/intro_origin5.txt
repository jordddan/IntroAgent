The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, largely due to the success of pre-training methods such as BERT and XLNet. However, these methods have limitations, such as neglecting dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that addresses these limitations and unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM). 

MPNet introduces a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing the model to consider the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-trained MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tuned it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB. Our experiments show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

Our proposed method is motivated by the need to improve the performance of pre-training methods in natural language processing tasks. The importance and relevance of this work lies in its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. The specific research questions and objectives of this paper are to propose a new pre-training method that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations, and to evaluate its performance on various downstream tasks.

Related work in this field includes autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, such as JANUS, BANG, and ProphetNet, as well as the Transformer architecture proposed in Attention Is All You Need. However, our proposed method differs from these works in its approach to addressing the limitations of MLM and PLM, and its use of a new approach to splitting tokens in a sequence. 

In summary, this paper proposes a new pre-training method called MPNet that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. We evaluate its performance on various downstream tasks and show that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. This work has important implications for the advancement of natural language processing tasks and represents a significant contribution to the AI community.
