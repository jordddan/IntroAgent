Pre-training methods have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to learn from large amounts of unlabeled data. Among these methods, Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) have shown great success in capturing contextual information and improving downstream task performance. However, both methods have their limitations, such as the lack of consideration for token dependencies in MLM and the position discrepancy in PLM. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet), which unifies the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. MPNet takes into consideration the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and also takes the position information of all tokens as input to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. Our experiments show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and also outperforms previous well-known models such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa on the GLUE dev sets. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of MPNet, which has the potential to improve the performance of NLP models on various downstream tasks. In this introduction, we provide context for the proposed method by summarizing related work in non-technical language and use concrete examples to make technical concepts accessible to a wider audience. We illustrate the significance of the research with anecdotes that are accessible to non-experts and end the introduction with a clear and concise statement of the main contribution of the paper.
