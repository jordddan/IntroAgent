The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of pre-trained language models. Among these models, BERT has been one of the most successful, but it suffers from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. To address this issue, XLNet was introduced as a generalized autoregressive method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. 

XLNet does not suffer from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy that BERT is subject to, and the autoregressive objective provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens, eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT. Additionally, architectural designs for pretraining have been improved by incorporating the recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme of Transformer-XL into pretraining, which empirically improves performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences. 

To remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling, a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network was proposed. Empirical results demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. 

Related works have also explored the combination of autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, such as JANUS, which proposes a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method using an auxiliary loss to enhance the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously and effectively alleviate the problem of distribution discrepancy. BANG is another pre-training model that bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation by designing a novel model structure for large-scale pretraining. 

In conclusion, XLNet has made significant contributions to the field of pre-trained language models by introducing a generalized autoregressive method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. The proposed reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network and improved architectural designs for pretraining have also contributed to the success of XLNet. Empirical results demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems. Related works have also explored the combination of autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, which have shown promising results.
