Introduction:

The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the development of new neural network architectures for sequence modeling and transduction problems. One such architecture is the Transformer, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the Transformer, the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, and the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner.

The Transformer architecture allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is a significant improvement over previous models that relied on recurrent networks and convolutional neural networks. The Transformer architecture achieves this by using scaled dot-product attention, which allows the model to attend to all positions in the input sequence simultaneously. Multi-head attention is also used to improve the model's ability to capture different types of dependencies between input and output.

The parameter-free position representation is another key component of the Transformer architecture. This representation allows the model to learn the position of each token in the input sequence without the need for additional parameters. This is achieved by using sinusoidal functions of different frequencies to encode the position information.

To implement and evaluate the Transformer architecture, the tensor2tensor library was developed. This library allows for the training of deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, making it possible to train the Transformer architecture on large datasets.

In summary, the Transformer architecture, with its reliance on attention mechanisms and the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing. The development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, has also made it possible to implement and evaluate the Transformer architecture on large datasets.
