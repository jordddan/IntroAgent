Paragraph 1: Establishing the motivation for the research and explaining its importance and relevance to the AI community.

Sequence generation tasks have been widely studied in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been proposed to tackle these tasks. While AR models achieve excellent performance, they suffer from slow decoding speed, which limits their practical applications. On the other hand, NAR models can generate sequences in parallel, but they often sacrifice performance due to the lack of dependency modeling. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. This paper proposes JANUS, a novel method that achieves this goal and demonstrates its effectiveness on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models.

Paragraph 2: Clearly stating the problem the paper is addressing, the proposed solution, and the specific research questions or objectives.

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. JANUS proposes an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. The paper aims to answer the following research questions: Can JANUS improve the performance of both AR and NAR models? How does JANUS compare to state-of-the-art NAR models without distillation data? Can JANUS improve the performance of autoregressive pretraining models?

Paragraph 3: Briefly mentioning key related work for context.

Several related works have been proposed to address the limitations of AR and NAR models. For example, CeMAT is a pre-training model that consists of a bidirectional encoder, a bidirectional decoder, and a cross-attention module for bridging them. BANG is a pre-training model that bridges the gap between AR and NAR generation by designing a novel model structure for large-scale pretraining. IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION proposes a Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC) that addresses the problems of indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference. These related works provide valuable insights into the development of JANUS.

Paragraph 4: Explaining the main differences from the related work.

Compared to the related works, JANUS proposes an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. JANUS also demonstrates its effectiveness on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Furthermore, JANUS exceeds the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieves comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism. These differences make JANUS a promising method for improving the performance of both AR and NAR models. 

In summary, this paper proposes JANUS, a novel method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. JANUS proposes an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average.
