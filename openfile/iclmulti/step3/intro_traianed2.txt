Introduction:

The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the development of new neural network architectures for sequence modeling and transduction problems. One such architecture is the Transformer, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer has several key components, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which have been proposed to improve its performance.

The Transformer has been shown to allow for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is a significant improvement over previous models that relied on recurrent networks and required much longer training times. The development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, has also contributed to the success of the Transformer.

The introduction of the Transformer has had a significant impact on the field of natural language processing, and its key components have been widely adopted in other models. The scaled dot-product attention mechanism, for example, has been used in various other models, including BERT and XLNet. The multi-head attention mechanism has also been used in other models, such as the recently proposed ProphetNet.

In conclusion, the Transformer has been a significant development in the field of natural language processing, and its key components have contributed to the success of other models. The development of tensor2tensor has also been crucial in enabling the efficient training of deep learning models. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer and its key components, as well as its impact on the field of natural language processing.
