Introduction:

The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the introduction of new neural network architectures for sequence modeling and transduction problems. One such architecture is the Transformer, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. This paper presents the main contributions of the Transformer and its impact on the field of natural language processing.

The first contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is a significant improvement over previous models that relied on recurrent networks and required much longer training times.

The second contribution of this paper is the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. These components allow the Transformer to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks, and significantly improve its performance on natural language processing tasks.

The third contribution of this paper is the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. This library allows for the efficient training of deep learning models on large datasets, which is essential for achieving state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks.

Related works have explored various pretraining methods for natural language processing tasks, including non-autoregressive translation models, masked and permuted pre-training, and joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. These works have shown significant improvements in performance, but they still rely on recurrent networks and have longer training times than the Transformer.

In conclusion, the Transformer is a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing, allowing for significantly more parallelization and achieving state-of-the-art performance on translation quality. Its key components, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, have also significantly improved the performance of neural network architectures for sequence modeling and transduction problems. The development of tensor2tensor has also allowed for the efficient training of deep learning models on large datasets, which is essential for achieving state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks.
