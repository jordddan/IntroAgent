Introduction:

The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with the introduction of new neural network architectures for sequence modeling and transduction problems. One such architecture is the Transformer, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. This paper presents the main contributions of the Transformer, which include the introduction of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, all of which are key components of the Transformer architecture.

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is demonstrated through the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

In addition to the Transformer architecture, this paper proposes the use of pre-training models for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The paper introduces BANG, a new pre-training model designed to bridge the gap between Autoregressive (AR) and Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation. BANG is pre-trained using an efficient cross-stream visible n-stream decoder to realize parallelization, which supports predicting tokens with arbitrary previous golden tokens or [MASK]. BANG supports NAR, semi-NAR, and AR finetuning to meet different requirements with the same pretrained model structure. The paper demonstrates that BANG improves NAR and semi-NAR performance significantly as well as attaining comparable performance with strong AR pretrained models.

This paper also presents other related works in the field of pre-training models for natural language processing, including IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, MPNet: Masked and Permuted Pre-training for Abstract Acknowledgements and Disclosure of Funding Broader Impact References, ProphetNet: Predicting Future N-gram for Sequence-to-Sequence, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, JANUS: Joint Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive Training, XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining. These works have contributed to the development of new pre-training models and techniques for natural language processing tasks.

In summary, this paper presents the main contributions of the Transformer architecture, including the introduction of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. The paper also proposes the use of pre-training models for sequence-to-sequence tasks, demonstrated through the development of BANG. The related works presented in this paper have contributed to the advancement of pre-training models for natural language processing tasks.
