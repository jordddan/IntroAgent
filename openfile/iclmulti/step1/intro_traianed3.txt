Introduction:

Pre-trained neural networks have revolutionized the field of sequence modeling and transduction problems. Among the various pre-training objectives, autoregressive (AR) language modeling and autoencoding (AE) have been the two most successful. However, AR-based models may prefer to focus on the latest tokens rather than capture long-term dependencies for the next token prediction. On the other hand, AE-based pretraining does not perform explicit density estimation but instead aims to reconstruct the original data from corrupted input. 

To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

The Transformer architecture includes several key components, such as scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components enable the Transformer to capture bidirectional context and overcome the limitations of AR and AE-based pretraining. 

To implement and evaluate the Transformer, the paper also introduces tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. Tensor2tensor was used to pretrain and fine-tune the Transformer, demonstrating its effectiveness in various sequence modeling tasks. 

In summary, the contributions of this paper are the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, the demonstration of its effectiveness in various sequence modeling tasks, and the proposal of key components such as scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. The development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, is also a significant contribution of this paper.
