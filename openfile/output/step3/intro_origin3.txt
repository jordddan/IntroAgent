Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of sequence modeling and transduction problems. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the go-to architecture for these tasks, but they suffer from slow training times and limited parallelization. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for RNNs. 

The Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of AI, as it allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The Transformer architecture is composed of several key components, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components work together to create a highly efficient and effective sequence modeling and transduction system.

Our work builds on several related works in the field of AI, including ProphetNet, MPNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, JANUS, BANG, XLNet, and IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION. While these works have made significant contributions to the field, the Transformer architecture is unique in its reliance on attention mechanisms and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with significantly less training time.

In this paper, we aim to address the limitations of RNNs and other sequence modeling and transduction architectures by introducing the Transformer. Our proposed solution is highly efficient, effective, and scalable, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications. Our research questions and objectives include evaluating the performance of the Transformer on various tasks, comparing it to other state-of-the-art architectures, and exploring its potential for future developments in the field of AI.

In conclusion, the Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of AI, offering a highly efficient and effective solution to sequence modeling and transduction problems. Our work builds on related works in the field, but our proposed architecture is unique in its reliance on attention mechanisms and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with significantly less training time. We believe that the Transformer has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI and open up new possibilities for future developments.
