Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the key challenges in machine learning is pre-training models on large-scale text corpora to improve their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) while addressing their limitations.

Previous pre-training models, such as BERT and XLNet, have adopted MLM and PLM, respectively, to improve their performance on downstream tasks. However, MLM neglects the dependency among predicted tokens, while XLNet suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. To address these limitations, MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to reduce the position discrepancy.

We provide a comprehensive overview of related work, highlighting the gaps in the existing literature that our research aims to fill. We compare MPNet with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, and show that MPNet outperforms them by a large margin on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB.

We also introduce a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, which allows MPNet to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, achieving better results than previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel pre-training method, MPNet, that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. We provide a clear motivation for the proposed research, explaining why the proposed model is necessary and how it addresses the gaps in the existing literature. We explain the proposed model and techniques in detail, including the technical details and experimental results to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. We conclude the introduction with a summary of the key contributions and a clear roadmap for the rest of the paper.
