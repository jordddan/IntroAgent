Recent advancements in natural language processing have led to the development of various sequence-to-sequence models for generating text. Among these models, autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been widely used. AR models generate text sequentially, while NAR models generate text in parallel, resulting in faster inference times. However, AR models suffer from slow inference times, while NAR models often produce lower quality text due to the lack of sequential dependencies. 

To address these issues, we propose JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. JANUS introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. Our approach is designed to enhance the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously and effectively alleviate the problem of distribution discrepancy. 

We evaluate JANUS on multiple neural machine translation (NMT) datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Furthermore, we exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism. 

Our work is related to several other pretraining models, including BANG, ProphetNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, XLNet, MPNet, and CMLMC. While these models have made significant contributions to the field, our approach differs in that it combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. 

In summary, our work proposes a novel method for joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple NMT datasets and pretraining models. Our approach has the potential to significantly improve the quality of text generation while maintaining fast inference times, making it a valuable contribution to the AI community.
