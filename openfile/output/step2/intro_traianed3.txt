Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most important applications of machine learning is sequence modeling and transduction, which involves predicting the next element in a sequence based on the previous elements. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling, but they suffer from slow training and inference times due to their sequential nature. 

In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

We propose scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. We also develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. 

Our work builds upon and extends previous research in the field of machine learning. BANG bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation, while ProphetNet introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction. CeMAT demonstrates that pre-training a sequence-to-sequence model with a bidirectional decoder can produce notable performance gains for both autoregressive and non-autoregressive NMT. Attention Is All You Need proposes a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, which outperforms existing models on machine translation tasks. JANUS is a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method that enhances the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously. XLNet is a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence. CMLMC addresses the problems of indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference in non-autoregressive translation models. 

The main contribution of our work is the introduction of the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction that relies entirely on an attention mechanism. We demonstrate that the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality. We also propose scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. Our work has the potential to significantly impact the field of machine learning by enabling faster and more efficient sequence modeling and transduction. In the rest of this paper, we will describe the methodology and data used, the experimental setup and results, and provide a clear and concise roadmap for the rest of the paper, summarizing the key points and outlining the structure of the paper, including the main findings and conclusions.
