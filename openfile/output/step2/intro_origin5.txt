The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches like BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, these models suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the independence assumption made in BERT. To address these limitations, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. 

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. This approach overcomes the limitations of BERT and enables learning bidirectional contexts. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our work also proposes a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. Empirical results demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Related works in this field include BANG, ProphetNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, JANUS, MPNet, and IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION. While these works have made significant contributions to the field, our proposed XLNet approach differs in its ability to capture bidirectional context and overcome the limitations of BERT. 

In summary, our work proposes a novel pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding, enabling learning bidirectional contexts and overcoming the limitations of BERT. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming BERT on various tasks.
