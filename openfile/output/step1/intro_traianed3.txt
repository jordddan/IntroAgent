Machine learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. One of the most important applications of machine learning is sequence modeling and transduction, which involves predicting the next element in a sequence or mapping one sequence to another. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling, but they suffer from slow training and inference times due to their sequential nature. 

To address this issue, a new neural network architecture called the Transformer was introduced in the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need". The Transformer relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. This allows for significantly more parallelization and faster training and inference times. 

In addition to introducing the Transformer, the paper proposed several key components of the architecture, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. The paper also developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. 

Since the introduction of the Transformer, several related works have been proposed to improve its performance or extend its capabilities. For example, JANUS proposed a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method using an auxiliary loss to enhance the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously. XLNet introduced a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. BANG proposed a new pre-training model to bridge the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation. ProphetNet introduced a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. MPNet leveraged the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and took auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence. CMLMC proposed the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction that addressed the indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference. CeMAT pre-trained a sequence-to-sequence model but with a bidirectional decoder to produce notable performance gains for both Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive NMT. 

In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the Transformer and its related works, highlighting the gaps in the literature and comparing with existing literature. We propose a novel approach to improve the performance of the Transformer in sequence modeling and transduction tasks. Our approach builds on the Transformer architecture and leverages recent advances in deep learning to achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. Specifically, we introduce a novel attention mechanism that incorporates external knowledge into the Transformer, enabling it to better capture long-term dependencies and improve its generalization performance. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed review of the Transformer and its related works. Section 3 presents our proposed approach and its technical details. Section 4 presents the experimental setup and results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future directions for research.
