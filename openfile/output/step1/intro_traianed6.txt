Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in the field of natural language processing. While autoregressive (AR) models have achieved impressive performance, they suffer from slow decoding speed due to their sequential nature. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models, on the other hand, can generate translations in parallel, but they often lag behind their AR counterparts in terms of quality. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing NAR models that can approach AR performance without the need for distillation.

In this paper, we propose the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), a novel approach that addresses the shortcomings of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation. Our approach modifies the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. We also propose a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence.

To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our approach outperforms existing NAR models, including those trained with distillation. Our proposed approach has significant implications for the development of faster and more accurate NAR models for machine translation.

We also conduct a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the gaps in the literature and comparing with existing literature. We compare our approach with several state-of-the-art models, including JANUS, XLNet, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. Our proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing models and achieves superior performance on multiple benchmarks.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed overview of related work in the field of NAR machine translation. Section 3 describes our proposed approach in detail, including the technical details and experimental setup. Section 4 presents the experimental results and analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future directions for research.
