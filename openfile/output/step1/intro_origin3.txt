Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the field of sequence modeling and transduction problems. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the go-to architecture for these tasks, but they suffer from slow training times and limited parallelization. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for RNNs. 

The Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of AI, as it allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The Transformer architecture is composed of several key components, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components work together to create a highly efficient and effective sequence modeling and transduction system.

Our proposed solution is a departure from traditional RNN-based approaches, and it has several key differences from related work. For example, JANUS is a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method that uses an auxiliary loss to enhance the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously. XLNet is a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. BANG is a new pre-training model that bridges the gap between autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) generation. ProphetNet is a sequence-to-sequence pre-training model that introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. MPNet is a novel pre-training method that leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence. CMLMC is a conditional masked language model pre-trained on large-scale bilingual and monolingual corpora in many languages.

In contrast, our work proposes a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for RNNs. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. We also developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. 

In summary, the Transformer is a significant contribution to the field of AI, as it provides a highly efficient and effective sequence modeling and transduction system that relies entirely on an attention mechanism. Our work represents a departure from traditional RNN-based approaches and has several key differences from related work. We believe that the Transformer architecture and its components will have a significant impact on the field of AI and will pave the way for future research in this area.
