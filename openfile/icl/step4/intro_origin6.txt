Paragraph 1: Establishing the motivation for the research and explaining its importance and relevance to the AI community.

Sequence generation tasks have been widely studied in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and the performance of autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models has been a topic of interest. AR models have achieved excellent performance, but their decoding speed is slow, while NAR models have fast decoding speed but suffer from inferior performance. Therefore, there is a need to combine the strengths of both models to improve performance and decoding speed. In this paper, we propose JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. The proposed method is of great significance to the AI community as it can improve the performance of sequence generation tasks and accelerate the decoding speed.

Paragraph 2: Clearly state the problem you're addressing, your proposed solution, and the specific research questions or objectives.

The main problem we address in this paper is how to combine the strengths of AR and NAR models to improve performance and decoding speed. To solve this problem, we propose JANUS, a method that uses an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. The specific research questions and objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, to achieve similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data, and to improve the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Additionally, we aim to exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

Paragraph 3: Briefly mention key related work for context.

Several related works have been proposed to address the problem of combining the strengths of AR and NAR models. ProphetNet [0] introduced a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. XLNet [1] proposed a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts and overcomes the limitations of BERT. MPNet [3] leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence. JANUS differs from these works by using an auxiliary distribution to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other.

Paragraph 4: Explain the main differences from your work.

The main difference between JANUS and previous works is that JANUS uses an auxiliary distribution to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. ProphetNet, XLNet, and MPNet do not use an auxiliary distribution to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR. Additionally, JANUS aims to exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism, which is not addressed in previous works.

In summary, this paper proposes JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. The proposed method uses an auxiliary distribution to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. The effectiveness of JANUS is demonstrated on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Additionally, JANUS exceeds the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieves comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.
