INTRODUCTION

Neural machine translation (NMT) has made significant progress in recent years, with the introduction of new neural network architectures and pre-training methods. One of the most successful architectures is the Transformer, which was introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need". The Transformer is a neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. This paper presents the main contributions of the Transformer and its impact on the field of NMT.

The first contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Transformer architecture. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is achieved by relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer architecture has been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of NMT tasks, including machine translation, summarization, and question generation.

The second contribution of this paper is the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. Scaled dot-product attention allows the model to attend to all positions in the input sequence, while multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. The parameter-free position representation allows the model to encode the position of each token in the input sequence without the need for additional parameters.

The third contribution of this paper is the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. tensor2tensor provides a flexible and efficient platform for training a wide range of deep learning models, including the Transformer, and has been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in a wide range of NMT tasks.

In addition to the contributions of the Transformer architecture, this paper also discusses related works in the field of NMT. These include pre-training methods such as BERT, XLNet, and ProphetNet, as well as other neural network architectures such as the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training (CeMAT), and Joint Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive Training with Xiaobo Liang (JANUS). These works have made significant contributions to the field of NMT and have helped to advance the state of the art in machine translation and related tasks.

In summary, the Transformer architecture and its associated components have made significant contributions to the field of NMT, allowing for significantly more parallelization and achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks. The development of tensor2tensor has also provided a flexible and efficient platform for training deep learning models, including the Transformer. This paper provides an overview of the contributions of the Transformer and related works in the field of NMT, highlighting the impact of these developments on the field of machine translation.
