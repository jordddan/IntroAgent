Introduction:

Large-scale pre-training models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and have achieved remarkable success in various downstream tasks. However, traditional sequence-to-sequence models rely on recurrent networks, which can be time-consuming and limit parallelization. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. 

The Transformer architecture allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is demonstrated through the use of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. 

The key components of the Transformer architecture are scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. Scaled dot-product attention allows the model to attend to all positions in the input sequence simultaneously, while multi-head attention enables the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. The parameter-free position representation allows the model to encode the position information of the input sequence without the need for additional parameters.

In addition to the development of the Transformer architecture, we also introduce tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. This library was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer, demonstrating its effectiveness in various NLP tasks.

In conclusion, the contributions of this paper include the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. We also propose scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. Finally, we introduce tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.
