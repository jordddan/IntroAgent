Paragraph 1: Establishing the motivation for the research and explaining its importance and relevance to the AI community.

Pre-training models have become a popular paradigm for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. However, existing pre-training methods, such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM), have their limitations. MLM neglects the dependency among predicted tokens, while PLM does not leverage the full position information of a sentence, leading to position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet), which unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. MPNet is motivated by the need to improve the performance of pre-training models and to provide a more effective and efficient approach for NLP tasks.

Paragraph 2: Clearly stating the problem addressed, the proposed solution, and the specific research questions or objectives.

The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of MPNet, a new pre-training method that leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to reduce the position discrepancy. Specifically, MPNet splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to consider the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. The research questions addressed in this paper are: Can MPNet outperform existing pre-training methods, such as MLM and PLM, on various downstream benchmark tasks? Can MPNet provide a more effective and efficient approach for NLP tasks?

Paragraph 3: Briefly mentioning key related work for context and explaining the main differences from the proposed work.

Related work includes various pre-training methods, such as MLM and PLM, and models such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. However, MPNet differs from these methods and models in several ways. First, MPNet unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. Second, MPNet splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to consider the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. Third, MPNet outperforms existing pre-training methods and previous well-known models, such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, by a large margin on various downstream benchmark tasks.
