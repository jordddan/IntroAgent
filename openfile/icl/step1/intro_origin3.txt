Introduction:

Sequence modeling and transduction problems have been widely studied in the field of artificial intelligence. In recent years, neural network architectures have shown remarkable success in these areas. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. 

The Transformer architecture allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is a significant improvement over previous neural network architectures that relied on recurrent networks. 

The key components of the Transformer architecture are scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. These components allow the Transformer to effectively model long-range dependencies and capture bidirectional context. 

To implement and evaluate the Transformer, we developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. This library was used to train the Transformer and evaluate its performance on various tasks. 

Related works in the field of sequence modeling and transduction include JANUS, XLNet, ProphetNet, BANG, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. These works explore various approaches to improve the performance of neural network architectures for sequence modeling and transduction problems. 

In summary, the Transformer architecture, along with its key components and the tensor2tensor library, represents a significant advancement in the field of sequence modeling and transduction. Its ability to effectively model long-range dependencies and capture bidirectional context has led to state-of-the-art performance on various tasks.
