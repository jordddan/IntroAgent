Introduction:

Sequence modeling and transduction problems have been widely studied in the field of deep learning. In recent years, neural network architectures have been developed to address these problems, including autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. However, these models have limitations, such as the inability to capture bidirectional context and the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. 

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is achieved through the use of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. 

To implement and evaluate the Transformer, we developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. This library was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer on a variety of tasks, including machine translation, language understanding, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. 

Related works in the field include the XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all possible permutations of the factorization order. Another related work is the ProphetNet, a sequence-to-sequence pre-training model that introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. Additionally, BANG is a pre-training model that bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation, while MPNet is a novel pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. Finally, CMLMC is a conditional masked language model that addresses the problems of indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference in non-autoregressive translation models. 

In summary, the Transformer architecture and tensor2tensor library, along with related works, have significantly advanced the field of sequence modeling and transduction problems. The contributions of this paper provide a new approach to addressing the limitations of previous models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer on a variety of tasks.
