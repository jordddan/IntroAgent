Introduction:

Sequence modeling and transduction problems have been widely studied in the field of deep learning. In recent years, neural network architectures have been developed to address these problems, including autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding. However, these methods have limitations, such as the inability to capture bidirectional context and the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. 

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This is achieved through the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. 

To implement and evaluate the Transformer, we developed tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. This library was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer in various tasks, including machine translation, language understanding, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. 

Related works have explored the limitations of existing pretraining methods and proposed new approaches to address these limitations. For example, XLNet is a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. BANG is a pretraining model that bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation by designing a novel model structure for large-scale pretraining. ProphetNet is a sequence-to-sequence pre-training model that introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. 

In conclusion, the Transformer architecture and its components have significantly improved the performance of sequence modeling and transduction problems. The related works have also proposed new pretraining methods to address the limitations of existing approaches. These advancements have opened up new possibilities for deep learning models in various tasks and applications.
