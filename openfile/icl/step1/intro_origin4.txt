Paragraph 1: Establishing the motivation for the research and explaining its importance and relevance to the AI community.

Recent advances in pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models have significantly improved the performance of natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as summarization, question generation, and machine translation. However, existing models such as BERT and XLNet have limitations in terms of their pre-training objectives and architecture. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet with a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. The proposed model aims to improve the quality of NLG tasks and reduce the pre-training cost.

Paragraph 2: Clearly state the problem you're addressing, your proposed solution, and the specific research questions or objectives.

The proposed ProphetNet model addresses the limitations of existing pre-trained models by introducing a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. The model is optimized by n-step ahead prediction that predicts the next n tokens simultaneously based on previous context tokens at each time step. This encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. The model also extends the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. The specific research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How does the proposed ProphetNet model perform on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks compared to existing models? (2) What is the impact of the future n-gram prediction objective on the performance of the model? (3) How does the n-stream self-attention mechanism improve the performance of the model?

Paragraph 3: Briefly mention key related work for context.

Several related works have explored the use of pre-trained models for NLG tasks. BERT and XLNet are two popular models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLG tasks. However, these models have limitations in terms of their pre-training objectives and architecture. Other related works such as JANUS, BANG, MPNet, and CMLMC have proposed new pre-training methods and architectures to address these limitations and improve the performance of NLG tasks.

Paragraph 4: Explain the main differences from your work.

Compared to existing pre-trained models, ProphetNet introduces a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and extends the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention. The proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. The model also achieves the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.

Paragraph 5: Summarize the contributions of the paper.

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are: (1) Introducing a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet with a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. (2) Developing a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. (3) Extending the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. (4) Pre-training ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieving new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. (5) Fine-tuning ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieving the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.
