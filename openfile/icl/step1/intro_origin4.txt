Paragraph 1: Establishing the motivation for the research and explaining its importance and relevance to the AI community.

Recent advances in pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models have significantly improved the performance of natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as summarization, question generation, and machine translation. However, most of these models rely on autoregressive (AR) decoding, which generates one token at a time and can be computationally expensive, especially for long sequences. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been proposed to address this issue, but they often lag behind their AR counterparts in terms of performance. In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which combines the advantages of both AR and NAR models and achieves state-of-the-art results on several NLG tasks.

Paragraph 2: Clearly stating the problem the paper is addressing, the proposed solution, and the specific research questions or objectives.

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of ProphetNet, a new pre-trained Seq2Seq model that uses a novel self-supervised objective called future n-gram prediction to optimize n-step ahead prediction. This encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. We also extend the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. Our specific research questions are: Can ProphetNet achieve state-of-the-art results on NLG tasks? How does the future n-gram prediction objective improve the performance of the model? How does the n-stream self-attention mechanism improve the model's ability to predict future tokens?

Paragraph 3: Briefly mentioning key related work for context.

Previous work has explored various pre-training objectives and architectures for Seq2Seq models, including autoregressive language modeling, autoencoding, and permutation-based AR modeling. BERT, one of the most successful pre-training models, uses masked language modeling (MLM) to optimize one-step ahead prediction. XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) to address the limitations of MLM, but suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. Recent work has also explored NAR approaches to accelerate inference, but these models often lag behind their AR counterparts in terms of performance.

Paragraph 4: Explaining the main differences from the related work.

ProphetNet differs from previous pre-trained Seq2Seq models in several ways. First, it uses a novel self-supervised objective called future n-gram prediction to optimize n-step ahead prediction, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. Second, we extend the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. Third, we pre-train ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. Fourth, we fine-tune ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieve the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.

Paragraph 5: Summarizing the contributions of the paper.

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are: 1) Introducing a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet with a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. 2) Developing a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. 3) Extending the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. 4) Pre-training ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieving new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. 5) Fine-tuning ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieving the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.
