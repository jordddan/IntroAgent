INTRODUCTION

Pre-training models on large-scale text corpora has become a popular approach to improve the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Among the pre-training objectives, Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) have been the two most successful approaches. MLM aims to estimate the probability distribution of a text corpus with an autoregressive model, while PLM maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order. However, both MLM and PLM have their limitations, and a unified pre-training method that combines the advantages of both approaches is still lacking.

In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. MPNet introduces a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, which allows MPNet to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of MPNet, we pre-train it on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB. Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

Related works have explored various pre-training methods, including JANUS, BANG, ProphetNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. JANUS is a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method that uses an auxiliary loss to enhance the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously. BANG bridges AR and NAR generation by designing a novel model structure for large-scale pre-training. ProphetNet introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training pre-trains a sequence-to-sequence model with a bidirectional decoder and produces notable performance gains for both Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive NMT.

In summary, our proposed MPNet pre-training method unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms previous well-known models on various downstream benchmark tasks. The related works have explored various pre-training methods, and our proposed MPNet method contributes to the advancement of pre-training models in NLP.
