Revised key steps for the introduction section of an academic paper:

1. Clearly state the problem statement and research questions/objectives, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the need for a new approach.
2. Provide a clear and concise statement of the main contribution of the paper and a clear motivation for the proposed approach, including a detailed explanation of the self-supervised objective and the n-stream self-attention mechanism.
3. Provide a comprehensive review of related works in the field, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and how the proposed approach differs from them. The review should be formal and detailed, and should clearly explain how the proposed approach fills the gaps in the existing literature.
4. Clearly explain the proposed approach and its key components, including the methodology and evaluation methodology. The explanation should be formal and detailed, and should clearly explain how the proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing methods.
5. Compare the proposed model with related works, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, including a comparison with other similar studies in the field.
6. Conclude with a summary of the main contributions and the significance of the proposed model, including a clear explanation of how the proposed approach can be applied in practice and how it can benefit the AI community. Additionally, provide more detailed analysis and interpretation of the results section, explain the methodology used more clearly, and provide more information on the dataset used. The conclusion should be more concise and highlight the main contributions of the study.
