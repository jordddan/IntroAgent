The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of pre-trained language models. Autoregressive (AR) language modeling and autoencoding (AE) have been the two most successful pre-training objectives. However, AR language modeling is limited in its ability to capture bidirectional context, while AE-based pre-training suffers from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. To address these limitations, this paper introduces XLNet, a generalized autoregressive method that combines the best of both AR language modeling and AE while avoiding their limitations.

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Unlike BERT, XLNet does not suffer from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy, and the autoregressive objective provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens, eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT.

To improve architectural designs for pretraining, this paper incorporates the recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme of Transformer-XL into pretraining, which empirically improves performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences. Additionally, this paper proposes a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling.

Empirical results demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. Related works in the field have explored permutation-based AR modeling, but previous models aim to improve density estimation by baking an "orderless" inductive bias into the model while XLNet is motivated by enabling AR language models to learn bidirectional contexts.

In conclusion, this paper introduces XLNet, a generalized autoregressive method that combines the best of both AR language modeling and AE while avoiding their limitations. The proposed approach fills the gaps in the existing literature by enabling AR language models to learn bidirectional contexts and eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT. The proposed approach can be applied in practice and can benefit the AI community.
