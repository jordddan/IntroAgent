Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In this paper, we focus on the problem of language modeling, which is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Specifically, we introduce XLNet, a novel pre-training method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. 

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) introducing XLNet, which maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context; (2) overcoming the pretrain-finetune discrepancy that BERT is subject to, and eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT; (3) improving architectural designs for pretraining by incorporating the recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme of Transformer-XL into pretraining, which empirically improves performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences; (4) proposing a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling; and (5) empirically demonstrating that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Related works in this area include Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, ProphetNet, BANG, JANUS, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, MPNet, and Attention Is All You Need. These works have made significant contributions to the field of language modeling, but none of them have addressed the limitations of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding, as XLNet does.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related work in the field of language modeling. Section 3 describes the proposed XLNet model in detail. Section 4 presents the experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future work.
