Machine learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling significant advances in tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question answering. One of the key challenges in this field is developing models that can effectively capture long-range dependencies between input and output sequences. Recurrent neural networks have been the dominant approach for sequence modeling, but they suffer from slow training times and limited parallelization.

In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture for sequence modeling and transduction problems that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 

We build on a rich body of related work in the field of machine learning, including recent advances in pre-training models for natural language processing. For example, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, ProphetNet, and MPNet have all demonstrated significant improvements in performance for sequence-to-sequence tasks. BANG and JANUS have proposed new pre-training models that bridge the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation. XLNet has introduced a generalized autoregressive pre-training method that outperforms previous approaches on a range of tasks. 

Our proposed approach builds on these advances by introducing scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. We also develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. 

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of sequence-to-sequence tasks, 2) the demonstration that the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and faster training times than previous approaches, 3) the proposal of novel attention mechanisms and position representations that improve the performance of the Transformer, and 4) the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner. 

In the following sections, we provide a detailed description of the Transformer architecture, including its attention mechanisms and position representations. We then evaluate the performance of the Transformer on a range of sequence-to-sequence tasks, including machine translation and summarization. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results and potential directions for future research.
