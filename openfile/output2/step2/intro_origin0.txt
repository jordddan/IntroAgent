Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. In this paper, we address the problem of pre-training language models, which is a crucial step in many downstream natural language processing tasks. Our research question is how to improve the performance of pre-training methods by addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

We propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet), which unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) while addressing their limitations. MPNet splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB, which outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

Our approach builds on the success of previous pre-training methods, including BERT, XLNet, and Transformer, and addresses their limitations. We compare our approach with related works, including Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, BANG, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, ProphetNet, and JANUS. Our approach outperforms these methods on various benchmark tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for future research.

In the following sections, we provide a detailed description of our approach, including the architecture of MPNet, the pre-training process, and the fine-tuning on downstream tasks. We also present experimental results and analysis, followed by a discussion of related work and future research directions.
