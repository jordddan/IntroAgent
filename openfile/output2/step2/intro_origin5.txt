Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP) and neural machine translation (NMT). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) machine translation, which can translate blocks of tokens in parallel, unlike autoregressive (AR) models that translate one token at a time. However, leading NAR models still lag behind their AR counterparts, and only become competitive when trained with distillation. 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which addresses the shortcomings of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation. Our approach modifies the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. We also propose a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. 

Our experiments show that CMLMC achieves state-of-the-art NAR performance when trained on raw data without distillation, and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a correction loss for NAR machine translation. 

In addition, we provide a brief overview of related works, including MPNet, XLNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, Attention Is All You Need, BANG, ProphetNet, and JANUS. These works have made significant contributions to the field of NLP and NMT, and our approach builds upon their successes. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of our proposed approach, including the CMLMC model architecture and the correction loss. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results, comparing our approach to state-of-the-art NAR and AR models. Section 4 provides a discussion of the results and their implications, and Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the main contributions and directions for future research.
