Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing neural network architectures that can model complex sequences and transduction problems. One of the most promising approaches is the Transformer, a neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks.

The Transformer has shown significant improvements in various sequence modeling tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition. In this paper, we present the main contributions of our work, which include the introduction of the Transformer architecture, the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, and the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner.

Our work demonstrates that the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation of the Transformer on various machine translation tasks, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

In addition to our contributions, we also provide a brief overview of related works, including MPNet, XLNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, BANG, Improving Non-Autoregressive Translation Models without Distillation, ProphetNet, and JANUS. These works have made significant contributions to the field of sequence modeling and transduction, and our work builds upon their insights and methodologies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a detailed description of the Transformer architecture, including its key components and training methodology. In Section 3, we present our experimental results, including a comprehensive evaluation of the Transformer on various machine translation tasks. Finally, in Section 4, we conclude the paper and discuss future directions for research in this area.
