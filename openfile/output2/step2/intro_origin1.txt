Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, pretraining models have shown remarkable success in improving the performance of downstream tasks. However, existing pretraining methods have limitations, such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy in BERT and the independence assumption in autoregressive language modeling. 

In this paper, we introduce XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Additionally, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences. 

We also propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Related works have also been proposed to address the limitations of existing pretraining methods. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to reduce the position discrepancy. CeMAT pretrains a sequence-to-sequence model with a bidirectional decoder and enhances it with aligned code-switching & masking and dynamic dual-masking. CMLMC addresses the indistinguishability of tokens and mismatch between training and inference in non-autoregressive translation models. BANG bridges the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation with a novel model structure for large-scale pretraining. ProphetNet introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. JANUS is a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method using an auxiliary loss to enhance the model performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously and effectively alleviate the problem of distribution discrepancy.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of XLNet and its superiority over existing pretraining methods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of XLNet and its architecture. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results. Section 4 discusses related work, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
