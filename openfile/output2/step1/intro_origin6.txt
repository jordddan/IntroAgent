Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation. Non-autoregressive (NAR) machine translation models have gained attention due to their fast decoding speed, but they often lag behind their autoregressive (AR) counterparts in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which addresses the shortcomings of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation.

Our approach modifies the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. We also propose a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. Our experiments show that CMLMC achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks.

Related works in this field include JANUS, which proposes a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method, XLNet, which introduces a generalized autoregressive pretraining method, and BANG, which bridges the gap between AR and NAR generation. Attention Is All You Need proposes a new simple network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, while ProphetNet presents a new sequence-to-sequence pre-training model. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training demonstrates that pre-training a sequence-to-sequence model with a bidirectional decoder can produce notable performance gains for both AR and NAR NMT.

In this paper, we build on these works by proposing a novel approach that addresses the shortcomings of existing NAR machine translation models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work, Section 3 describes our proposed approach in detail, Section 4 presents our experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future work.
