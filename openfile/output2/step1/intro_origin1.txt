Machine learning has become an essential tool in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In particular, language modeling has been a crucial area of research, with the goal of developing models that can understand and generate human-like language. However, traditional language models suffer from limitations such as the inability to capture bidirectional context and the independence assumption made in training.

In this paper, we introduce XLNet, a generalized autoregressive method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Additionally, XLNet does not suffer from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy that BERT is subject to, and the autoregressive objective provides a natural way to use the product rule for factorizing the joint probability of the predicted tokens, eliminating the independence assumption made in BERT.

We also propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. Furthermore, we improve architectural designs for pretraining by incorporating the recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme of Transformer-XL into pretraining, which empirically improves performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Empirical results demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. Our work builds upon related works such as JANUS, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, and provides a novel approach to language modeling that overcomes the limitations of previous methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the XLNet model and its training procedure. Section 3 presents experimental results on various benchmark datasets, comparing XLNet to other state-of-the-art models. Section 4 analyzes the performance of XLNet on different tasks and provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future directions for research in this area.
