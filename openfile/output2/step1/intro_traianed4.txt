Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, as they have shown to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, existing pre-trained models have limitations, such as neglecting dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from pretrain-finetune discrepancy. 

In this paper, we propose a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which introduces a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. The ProphetNet model is optimized by n-step ahead prediction that predicts the next n tokens simultaneously based on previous context tokens at each time step. The future n-gram prediction explicitly encourages the model to plan for the future tokens and prevent overfitting on strong local correlations. 

Our proposed method has several contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which achieves new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 benchmarks for abstractive summarization and question generation tasks. Secondly, we develop a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. Thirdly, we extend the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. 

In addition, we provide a comprehensive overview of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and how the proposed approach differs from them. We compare our proposed method with several related works, including JANUS, XLNet, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, MPNet, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. 

We pre-train ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. We also fine-tune ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieve the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset. 

In summary, our proposed method, ProphetNet, introduces a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism, which achieves new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks for abstractive summarization and question generation tasks. Our proposed method advances the field of machine learning by addressing the limitations of existing pre-trained models and providing a more effective approach for sequence-to-sequence modeling.
