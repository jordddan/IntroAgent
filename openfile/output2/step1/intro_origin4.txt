Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP). In NLP, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as summarization and question generation. However, traditional Seq2Seq models suffer from overfitting on strong local correlations and lack the ability to plan for future tokens. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which utilizes a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction. 

ProphetNet is optimized by predicting the next n tokens simultaneously based on previous context tokens at each time step, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. The model also extends the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. 

The paper presents experimental results on several benchmarks, including CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1, for abstractive summarization and question generation tasks. The results show that ProphetNet achieves new state-of-the-art results on all these datasets compared to the models using the same scale pre-training corpus. 

In addition, the paper provides a brief overview of related works, including JANUS, XLNet, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, MPNet, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. These works have contributed to the development of Seq2Seq models and have inspired the proposed approach in this paper. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the proposed ProphetNet model, including the self-supervised objective and the n-stream self-attention mechanism. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results on several benchmarks. Section 4 discusses the limitations and future directions of the proposed approach. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and summarizes the main contributions.
