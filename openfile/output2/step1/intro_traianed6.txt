Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing and machine translation. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) machine translation models due to their faster decoding speed. However, NAR models have not yet achieved the same level of performance as autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the limitations of existing NAR models and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

The main objective of this paper is to propose a Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC) for NAR machine translation. The proposed approach builds upon the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) and addresses its shortcomings by modifying the decoder structure and introducing a novel correction loss. The CMLMC model is designed to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence, which improves the overall translation quality.

The proposed approach is compared to several related works, including JANUS, XLNet, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. These related works have made significant contributions to the field of machine learning, but they have limitations that the proposed approach addresses. For example, JANUS is a joint AR and NAR training method, but it does not address the problem of distribution discrepancy. XLNet is a generalized autoregressive pretraining method, but it suffers from the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. BANG bridges AR and NAR generation, but it does not leverage the full position information of a sentence. ProphetNet introduces a novel self-supervised objective, but it does not address the problem of overfitting on strong local correlations. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens, but it suffers from the position discrepancy. Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training pre-trains a sequence-to-sequence model with a bidirectional decoder, but it does not address the problem of NAR machine translation.

The proposed CMLMC approach modifies the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. The novel correction loss teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks.

In summary, the proposed CMLMC approach addresses the limitations of existing NAR machine translation models and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The proposed approach builds upon related works and introduces novel modifications to the decoder structure and loss function. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its potential to advance the field of machine learning.
