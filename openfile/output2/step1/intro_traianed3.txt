Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing neural network architectures that can model complex sequences and transduction problems. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a new neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks.

The main contribution of this paper is four-fold. Firstly, we propose the Transformer architecture, which allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. Secondly, we introduce scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. Thirdly, we develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer on various sequence modeling and transduction tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition.

Related works in this field include autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, such as JANUS, XLNet, and BANG. While these models have achieved significant improvements in sequence generation tasks, they suffer from limitations such as distribution discrepancy and neglecting dependency among predicted tokens. In contrast, the Transformer architecture proposed in this paper addresses these limitations by relying entirely on an attention mechanism and introducing novel components such as multi-head attention and parameter-free position representation.

In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of the proposed Transformer architecture, including the methodology used and the experimental setup. We also present extensive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Transformer on various sequence modeling and transduction tasks. Overall, the proposed approach advances the field of machine learning by introducing a new neural network architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various sequence modeling and transduction tasks.
