Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing new neural network architectures that can handle complex sequence modeling and transduction problems. One such architecture is the Transformer, which relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks.

The Transformer has shown significant improvements in various tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition. In this paper, we present the main contributions of our work, which include the introduction of the Transformer architecture, the proposal of scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, and the development of tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner.

Our work demonstrates that the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. We also provide a comprehensive overview of related works, including JANUS, XLNet, BANG, ProphetNet, MPNet, and CMLMC, which have contributed to the development of the Transformer architecture.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a detailed description of the Transformer architecture and its key components. In Section 3, we present the experimental results and compare the performance of the Transformer with other state-of-the-art models. Finally, in Section 4, we conclude the paper and discuss future directions for research.
