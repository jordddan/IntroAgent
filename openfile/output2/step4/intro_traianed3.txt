Recent advances in machine learning have led to significant improvements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question generation. However, there is still a significant gap between the performance of current models and human-level accuracy. One of the main challenges in NLP is to develop models that can effectively capture long-term dependencies and plan for future tokens. 

In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which addresses the challenge of planning for future tokens by introducing a novel self-supervised objective called future n-gram prediction. We also develop a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, which encourages the model to plan for future tokens and prevents overfitting on strong local correlations. Additionally, we extend the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction.

Our proposed approach is pre-trained on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, using only about 1/3 pre-training epochs of BART and about 1/5 pre-training corpus of T5 and PEGASUS. Furthermore, we fine-tune ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieve the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce a self-supervised objective for future n-gram prediction and extend the two-stream self-attention to n-stream self-attention. Our approach addresses the gaps in the literature and is novel and innovative, as supported by experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art models. We provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the gaps in the literature that our paper aims to address, and explaining the need for a new approach. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a detailed description of our proposed approach. In Section 3, we present the experimental setup and results. In Section 4, we analyze the experimental results and compare our approach with state-of-the-art models. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5 and discuss future research directions.
