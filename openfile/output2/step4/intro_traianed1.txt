The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pretraining-based approaches like BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, these approaches suffer from limitations such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy and the neglect of dependency among predicted tokens. In this paper, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that overcomes these limitations and achieves superior performance on a wide range of tasks.

XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. This approach combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL into pretraining, improving architectural designs and achieving better performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

Our proposed approach is motivated by the need to address the gaps in the literature and provide a novel and innovative solution to the limitations of existing pretraining-based approaches. We provide experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of XLNet over BERT on a wide range of tasks, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

We also provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the gaps in the literature that our proposed approach aims to address. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art models and provide a clear motivation for our proposed approach.

In this paper, we aim to contribute to the field of natural language processing by proposing a novel and innovative pretraining method that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and achieves superior performance on a wide range of tasks. We provide experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art models, and we believe that our proposed approach will advance the field and inspire further research. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed description of our proposed approach, Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results, and Section 4 provides a discussion and analysis of the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.
