Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing new neural network architectures that can handle complex sequence modeling and transduction problems. In this paper, we introduce the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks.

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. This paper proposes scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation, which are key components of the Transformer architecture. Additionally, we develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

This paper builds upon related works such as BERT, XLNet, and ProphetNet, which have achieved significant performance improvements in natural language processing tasks. We also investigate non-autoregressive translation models and propose the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC) to address the performance gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models. Furthermore, we propose JANUS, a Joint Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive training method, and BANG, a pre-training model to bridge the gap between autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation.

In summary, this paper presents a novel neural network architecture, the Transformer, and its key components, which achieve state-of-the-art performance in sequence modeling and transduction problems. The proposed architecture and related works are evaluated on various natural language processing tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness and potential for future research. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related works, Section 3 describes the Transformer architecture, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
