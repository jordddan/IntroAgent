Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. In this paper, we address the problem of pre-training language models, which is a crucial step in many natural language processing tasks. Our objective is to propose a new pre-training method that unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) while addressing their limitations.

We introduce a new approach called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet), which splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts. This approach allows MPNet to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB.

Our experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting. We also compare our work with related works, including XLNet, Attention Is All You Need, and ProphetNet, and show that MPNet achieves better results on various tasks.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel pre-training method that leverages the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmark tasks and outperforms previous well-known models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related works, Section 3 describes the proposed MPNet approach in detail, Section 4 presents the experimental setup and results, and Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future work.
