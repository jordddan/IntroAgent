Machine translation is a fundamental task in natural language processing, and has been extensively studied in recent years. Despite the remarkable progress made in this field, there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as the trade-off between translation quality and decoding speed. Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine translation, but suffer from slow decoding speed due to their sequential nature. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models, on the other hand, can generate translations in parallel, but often lag behind AR models in terms of translation quality. 

To address this trade-off, we propose JANUS, a method that combines the strengths of both AR and NAR models while avoiding their weaknesses. JANUS introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. Our approach is motivated by the observation that AR and NAR models have complementary strengths, and that combining them can lead to better performance. 

Our main contributions are four-fold. First, we propose JANUS, a novel method that combines AR and NAR models to improve performance. Second, we introduce an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JANUS on multiple NMT datasets and autoregressive pretraining models, achieving similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improving the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Fourth, we exceed the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieve comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to propose a joint training method that combines AR and NAR models in a principled way. Our approach is motivated by the observation that AR and NAR models have complementary strengths, and that combining them can lead to better performance. We compare our approach with several state-of-the-art models, and show that it achieves significant improvements in both translation quality and decoding speed. 

In the related work section, we review several recent approaches to machine translation, including MPNet, XLNet, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, ProphetNet, Attention Is All You Need, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, and BANG. We highlight the gaps in the literature that our work aims to address, and explain the need for a new approach. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the proposed JANUS method in detail. In Section 3, we present experimental results on multiple NMT datasets and pretraining models. In Section 4, we analyze the experimental results and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our approach. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5 and discuss future directions for research.
