Machine learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling computers to understand and generate human language. One of the key challenges in NLP is pre-training models on large-scale text corpora to learn general language representations that can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. While pre-training methods such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) have shown promising results, they suffer from limitations such as neglecting dependency among predicted tokens and position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. 

In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. MPNet splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, allowing it to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Our proposed approach is motivated by the need to address the limitations of existing pre-training methods and to improve the performance of NLP models. We provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the gaps in the literature that our paper aims to address. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art models such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, and show that MPNet outperforms them by a large margin on various benchmark tasks.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel pre-training method that unifies the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmark tasks and advances the field of NLP. The experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of our proposed approach. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed description of our proposed approach, Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results, and Section 4 concludes the paper.
