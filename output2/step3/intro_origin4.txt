Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP). One of the most challenging tasks in NLP is machine translation, which aims to translate text from one language to another. In recent years, non-autoregressive (NAR) machine translation has gained attention due to its ability to translate sentences in parallel, which significantly reduces the decoding time. However, NAR models still lag behind their autoregressive (AR) counterparts in terms of performance. 

In this paper, we propose the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which addresses the limitations of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation. CMLMC modifies the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. Additionally, we propose a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. 

Our experiments show that CMLMC achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a correction loss for NAR machine translation. 

In related works, several pre-training models have been proposed to improve NMT performance, including CeMAT, ProphetNet, BANG, JANUS, MPNet, XLNet, and Attention Is All You Need. These models adopt different pre-training objectives and architectures to enhance the performance of NMT models. However, none of these models address the limitations of NAR machine translation as effectively as CMLMC. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the proposed CMLMC model. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results. Section 4 discusses the limitations and future directions of our work. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.
