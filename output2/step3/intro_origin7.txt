Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing neural network architectures that can effectively model complex sequences and transduction problems. One of the most promising approaches in this area is the Transformer, a neural network architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, without the need for recurrent networks.

The main objective of this paper is to introduce the Transformer architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness in sequence modeling and transduction tasks. The paper proposes several key components of the Transformer, including scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the parameter-free position representation. The authors also develop tensor2tensor, a library for training deep learning models in a distributed and efficient manner, which was used to implement and evaluate the Transformer.

To put the contributions of this paper into context, we provide an overview of related works in the field of sequence modeling and transduction. These works include Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, ProphetNet, BANG, JANUS, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, MPNet, and XLNet. Each of these works proposes novel approaches to sequence modeling and transduction, and the authors of this paper build on these works to develop the Transformer architecture.

In summary, this paper presents a novel neural network architecture, the Transformer, that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to model complex sequences and transduction problems. The paper demonstrates that the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. The contributions of this paper have the potential to significantly advance the field of sequence modeling and transduction, and we believe that this work will be of great interest to researchers and practitioners in this area.
