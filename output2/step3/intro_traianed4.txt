Machine translation has been a long-standing challenge in natural language processing, with significant progress made in recent years through the use of neural machine translation (NMT) models. However, the traditional autoregressive (AR) approach to NMT suffers from slow decoding speed, making it impractical for real-time applications. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been proposed to address this issue, but they often lag behind their AR counterparts in terms of performance. 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to NAR machine translation that achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for distillation. Our Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC) addresses the shortcomings of the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) in NAR machine translation by modifying the decoder structure and introducing a novel correction loss. Specifically, we expose the positional encodings and incorporate causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens, and we teach the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. 

Our proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results and approaches AR performance on multiple NMT benchmarks. We compare our approach to several related works in the field, including Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, ProphetNet, BANG, JANUS, MPNet, XLNet, and Attention Is All You Need. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and explain how our proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing models. 

The importance of our work lies in its potential impact on real-time machine translation applications, where fast decoding speed is critical. Our proposed approach offers a significant improvement over existing NAR models, without the need for distillation. The main contributions of this paper are the proposed CMLMC approach, the modification of the decoder structure, the introduction of a novel correction loss, and the achievement of state-of-the-art undistilled NAR results. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background and related work, Section 3 describes our proposed approach in detail, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
