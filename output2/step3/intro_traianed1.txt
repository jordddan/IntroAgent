The field of natural language generation has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models playing a crucial role in improving performance. However, traditional models have limitations in optimizing one-step-ahead prediction and neglecting the dependency between predicted tokens. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet, which introduces a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction and a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase. The proposed model also extends the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, which includes a main stream self-attention and n extra self-attention predicting streams for future n-gram prediction. 

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of related works in the field, including Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training, BANG, JANUS, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, MPNet, XLNet, and Attention Is All You Need. The proposed approach builds on the strengths of these models while addressing their limitations. The importance of addressing the problem is explained, and a clear motivation for the proposed model or approach is provided. 

The main contributions of this paper are: introducing a new large-scale pre-trained Seq2Seq model called ProphetNet with a novel self-supervised objective future n-gram prediction, developing a method to simultaneously predict the future n-gram at each time step during the training phase, extending the two-stream self-attention proposed in XLNet to n-stream self-attention, pre-training ProphetNet on two scale pre-trained datasets and achieving new state-of-the-art results on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword, and fine-tuning ProphetNet on several NLG tasks and achieving the best performance on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 question generation tasks compared to the models using the same base scale pre-training dataset. 

In summary, this paper proposes a novel approach to natural language generation that addresses the limitations of traditional models and builds on the strengths of related works in the field. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on several NLG tasks and provides a significant contribution to the field of natural language generation. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the proposed model, Section 3 describes the experimental setup, Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future work.
