Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In this paper, we focus on the problem of language modeling, which is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Specifically, we introduce XLNet, a generalized autoregressive method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. 

The main objective of this paper is to address the limitations of existing pretraining methods, such as BERT, which neglects dependency among predicted tokens and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. XLNet overcomes these limitations by maximizing the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining, improving performance, especially for tasks involving longer text sequences.

In addition to introducing XLNet, we propose a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network to remove the ambiguity in naively applying a Transformer(-XL) architecture to permutation-based language modeling. We also empirically demonstrate that XLNet consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task.

Related works in this field include MPNet, which inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations, and ProphetNet, which introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. Other works, such as Attention Is All You Need, propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. JANUS and BANG are two other works that propose joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training methods to improve performance in both AR and NAR manner simultaneously.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the XLNet model and its training procedure. Section 3 presents the experimental results, comparing XLNet with other state-of-the-art models on various benchmark datasets. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.
