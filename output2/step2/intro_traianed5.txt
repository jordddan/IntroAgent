Machine translation has been a popular research area in natural language processing, and recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant improvements in translation quality. However, traditional autoregressive models that generate one token at a time can be computationally expensive, especially for long sequences. Non-autoregressive models that generate blocks of tokens in parallel have been proposed to address this issue, but they often lag behind their autoregressive counterparts in terms of performance. 

In this paper, we propose the Conditional Masked Language Model with Correction (CMLMC), which addresses the limitations of non-autoregressive machine translation models without the need for distillation. Our approach builds upon the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) and introduces a novel correction loss that teaches the model how to correct translation mistakes made in early decoding iterations from the fully masked sentence. We also modify the decoder structure of CMLM by exposing the positional encodings and incorporating causal attention layers to differentiate adjacent tokens. 

Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art non-autoregressive results and approaches autoregressive performance on multiple machine translation benchmarks. We compare our approach with several related works, including MPNet, XLNet, Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training (CeMAT), Attention Is All You Need, BANG, ProphetNet, and JANUS. Our approach outperforms these methods and fills the gap in the existing literature by providing a non-autoregressive approach that does not require distillation. 

We evaluate our approach on several datasets and provide a detailed analysis of the experimental results. Our approach achieves significant improvements in translation quality and demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed correction loss. The results of our study have significant implications for the field of machine translation and demonstrate the potential of non-autoregressive approaches for improving translation quality while reducing computational costs.
