Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In this paper, we focus on the problem of sequence generation, which is a fundamental task in many applications, such as machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue generation. 

The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel method, called JANUS, that combines the strengths of both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) generation models while avoiding their weaknesses to improve performance. JANUS introduces an auxiliary distribution P AUX to bridge the discrepancy between P AR and P NAR, which benefits AR and NAR to learn from each other. 

We compare JANUS with several related works, including MPNet, XLNet, CeMAT, Attention Is All You Need, BANG, Improving Non-Autoregressive Translation Models Without Distillation, and ProphetNet. Our experiments show that JANUS achieves similar results to the state-of-the-art NAR model without distillation data and improves the AR model performance by more than 1.5 BLEU scores on average. Moreover, JANUS exceeds the non-autoregressive pretraining model BANG on the same GLGE tasks and achieves comparable performance with the AR manner at least two times speedup based on the iterative inference mechanism.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of related works in the field of sequence generation. Section 3 describes the proposed JANUS method in detail. Section 4 presents the experimental results and analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.
