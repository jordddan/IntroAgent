The field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, with pre-training methods such as BERT and XLNet achieving state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks. However, these methods have limitations, such as neglecting the dependency among predicted tokens and suffering from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of both Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM) while addressing their limitations.

We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and how the proposed approach differs from them. We emphasize the need for a new approach and how it addresses the limitations of existing methods. We then describe the proposed model in detail, highlighting the novel aspects of the approach and how it addresses the research question. We explain the technical details of the proposed approach and how it differs from existing methods.

The main contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, we propose MPNet, a new pre-training method that leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and takes auxiliary position information as input to reduce the position discrepancy. Secondly, we introduce a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, which allows MPNet to consider the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. Finally, we pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB, which outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting.

We provide a detailed description of the experimental setup, including the dataset used, evaluation metrics, and any preprocessing steps. We explain how the experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed approach and how the results were analyzed. We conduct a thorough analysis and interpretation of the experimental results, including comparison with existing literature, and highlight the key findings and implications of the study. We explain the significance of the results and how they contribute to the field.

In conclusion, this paper proposes a new pre-training method that unifies the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks and outperforms existing methods by a large margin. The proposed approach has significant implications for the field of natural language processing and opens up new avenues for future research.
