Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in pretraining methods for language models, which have shown remarkable performance on various downstream tasks. However, existing pretraining methods have limitations, such as the pretrain-finetune discrepancy in BERT and the independence assumption in autoregressive language modeling. 

In this paper, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that combines the best of both autoregressive language modeling and autoencoding while avoiding their limitations. XLNet maximizes the expected log likelihood of a sequence with respect to all possible permutations of the factorization order, allowing each position to utilize contextual information from both left and right, capturing bidirectional context. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. 

Our proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing pretraining methods and consistently outperforms BERT on a wide spectrum of problems, including GLUE language understanding tasks, reading comprehension tasks like SQuAD and RACE, text classification tasks such as Yelp and IMDB, and the ClueWeb09-B document ranking task. 

Related works in this field include JANUS, which proposes a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method, BANG, which bridges autoregressive and non-autoregressive generation, and ProphetNet, which introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction. We also discuss Attention Is All You Need, which proposes a new simple network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, and MPNet, which inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. 

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and how the proposed approach differs from them. We explain the proposed method in detail, including the methodology used and the experimental setup. Our results demonstrate the significance of the proposed approach and how it advances the field of machine learning.
