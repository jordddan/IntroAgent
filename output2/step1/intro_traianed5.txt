Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, pre-training methods have shown remarkable success in improving the performance of downstream tasks. However, existing pre-training methods, such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Permuted Language Modeling (PLM), have their limitations. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called Masked and Permuted Language Modeling (MPNet) that unifies the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations.

The main contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, we introduce a new approach that splits the tokens in a sequence into non-predicted and predicted parts, which allows MPNet to take into consideration the dependency among the predicted tokens through permuted language modeling and the position information of all tokens to alleviate the position discrepancy of XLNet. Secondly, we pre-train MPNet on a large-scale text corpus and fine-tune it on various downstream benchmark tasks, including GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and IMDB, which outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by 4.8, 3.4, and 1.5 points, respectively, on GLUE dev sets under the same model setting. Thirdly, we propose a new pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and takes auxiliary position information as input to make the model see a full sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in XLNet).

Related works in this field include JANUS, XLNet, BANG, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, IMPROVING NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSLATION MODELS WITHOUT DISTILLATION, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. While these works have made significant contributions to the field, they have their limitations. For example, BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, while XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence. In contrast, MPNet unifies the advantages of both MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations.

In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of the proposed MPNet method, including the methodology used and the experimental setup. We also compare the performance of MPNet with existing pre-training methods on various downstream tasks. The results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large margin and previous well-known models BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. In conclusion, the proposed MPNet method advances the field of machine learning by unifying the advantages of MLM and PLM while addressing their limitations, and it has the potential to improve the performance of various downstream tasks.
