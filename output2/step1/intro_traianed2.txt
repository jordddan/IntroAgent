Machine learning has become an essential tool in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing large-scale pretraining models that can improve the performance of various machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale pretraining model called BANG, which is designed for Non-autoregressive (NAR) and semi-NAR generation. 

The main objective of this paper is to bridge the gap between Autoregressive (AR) and NAR generation by pretraining a generative model. BANG is pretrained using an efficient cross-stream visible n-stream decoder to realize parallelization, which supports predicting tokens with arbitrary previous golden tokens or [MASK]. BANG supports NAR, semi-NAR, and AR finetuning to meet different requirements with the same pretrained model structure. 

Our proposed approach differs from existing methods in several ways. First, BANG is the first large-scale pretraining model designed for NAR and semi-NAR generation. Second, BANG bridges the gap between AR and NAR generation by designing a novel model structure for large-scale pretraining. Third, BANG achieves significant performance improvements on all the tasks for NAR and semi-NAR finetuning, and for AR finetuning, it can attain comparable performance with the comparison to strong AR pretrained models. 

Related works in this field include JANUS, XLNet, Attention Is All You Need, ProphetNet, MPNet, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training. These works have made significant contributions to the field of machine learning, but they have limitations that our proposed approach addresses. For example, JANUS proposes a joint autoregressive and non-autoregressive training method, while XLNet introduces a generalized autoregressive pretraining method. Attention Is All You Need proposes a new simple network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, while ProphetNet introduces a novel self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction. MPNet leverages the dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling, and Universal Conditional Masked Language Pre-training pre-trains a sequence-to-sequence model but with a bidirectional decoder. 

In this paper, we propose BANG, a new pretraining model that bridges the gap between AR and NAR generation. BANG improves NAR and semi-NAR performance significantly and attains comparable performance with strong AR pretrained models. Our proposed approach advances the field of machine learning by providing a new large-scale pretraining model that can improve the performance of various machine learning tasks.
